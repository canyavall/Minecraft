/spark profiler --timeout 1800
/spark heap

# Phase 3: Stress test (35-45 minutes)
# Simulate player activity, chunk loading, etc.
/spark profiler --timeout 600
```

#### 3. Data Collection
```bash
# Collect all performance data
/spark profiler export
/spark tps export
/spark heap export

# System resource monitoring
top -b -n 600 -d 1 > system-resources.log
iostat -x 1 600 > io-stats.log
