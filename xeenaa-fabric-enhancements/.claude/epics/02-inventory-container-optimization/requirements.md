# Epic 02: Inventory and Container Optimization

**Created**: 2025
**Status**: PLANNING
**Priority**: High

## Business Value

Inventory and container operations are among the most frequent player interactions in Minecraft. Every item pickup, crafting operation, chest interaction, and inventory sorting triggers multiple server-client synchronization events. Optimizing these systems reduces network overhead, improves response times, and enhances the overall gameplay experience, especially in multiplayer environments with many simultaneous players.

**Target audience**: Multiplayer server administrators, players using large storage systems, modpack creators

## Overview

Optimize inventory management, container interactions, and item stack processing to reduce server load and improve player experience. Focus on reducing network overhead, improving response times, and minimizing memory allocations during frequent inventory operations.

## Features

### Feature 1: Optimized Item Stack Processing
**Description**: Faster and more efficient item stacking, splitting, and merging operations.

**User Experience**:
- Instant inventory operations (no delay when moving items)
- Smooth bulk item transfers
- Responsive crafting interactions
- No lag when sorting inventory

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 25% faster item stack operations
- [ ] Item operations complete in <10ms
- [ ] Reduced memory allocations during operations
- [ ] Full vanilla and modded item compatibility

### Feature 2: Container Synchronization Optimization
**Description**: Reduce network overhead for chest, barrel, and container interactions in multiplayer.

**User Experience**:
- Faster chest opening in multiplayer
- Smooth simultaneous container access
- Reduced lag when multiple players use storage
- Better performance in shops and storage halls

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 20% improvement in multiplayer sync latency
- [ ] 15% reduction in network packets per operation
- [ ] No desync issues between clients and server
- [ ] Optimized for high-traffic containers

### Feature 3: Inventory Operation Overhead Reduction
**Description**: Minimize CPU and memory overhead from frequent inventory operations.

**User Experience**:
- Better server TPS during mass item transfers
- Reduced lag in automated storage systems
- Smoother gameplay during inventory-heavy activities
- Better performance with hopper networks

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 20-30% reduction in operation overhead
- [ ] 20% reduction in memory allocations
- [ ] Improved garbage collection performance
- [ ] No gameplay functionality regressions

## Performance Targets

**Item Stack Operations**: 25% faster processing
**Network Packets**: 15% reduction per inventory interaction
**Operation Overhead**: 20-30% reduction
**Sync Latency**: 20% improvement in multiplayer
**Memory Allocations**: 20% reduction during operations

## Technical Considerations

- Must maintain vanilla inventory mechanics
- Modded item compatibility critical
- Network protocol compatibility required
- Server-client synchronization integrity

## Dependencies

- Performance benchmarking infrastructure (Epic 01)
- Network packet analysis tools

## Out of Scope

- Inventory UI redesign (visual changes)
- Custom inventory layouts
- Client-side only optimizations
- Modded inventory system changes

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic-Level)

- [ ] All performance targets met with statistical significance
- [ ] Zero inventory desync issues
- [ ] Full vanilla and modded item compatibility
- [ ] Network overhead reduced by 15%
- [ ] Multiplayer performance validated
- [ ] No gameplay regressions
