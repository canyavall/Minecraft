## Project-Specific Notes

### xeenaa-fabric-enhancements Focus:
This project is dedicated to **performance-first Minecraft optimizations**. Every feature MUST demonstrate measurable performance improvements.

### Key Principles:
1. **Measure Everything**: Baseline → Optimize → Validate
2. **No Guessing**: All optimizations backed by profiling data
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify optimizations work together
4. **Real-World Validation**: 48+ hour stability testing required
5. **Compatibility First**: Maintain vanilla behavior and mod compatibility

### Performance Requirements:
- All optimizations require before/after benchmarks
- Performance targets must be met for epic completion
- No regressions allowed in unrelated systems
- Automated regression detection prevents backsliding

### Quality Assurance:
- Comprehensive QA documentation in Epic 01 (qa/ folder)
- JMH microbenchmarking for precise measurements
- Spark profiler for real-time monitoring
- Multi-tier hardware testing (Tier 1/2/3)
- 48-hour stability testing before production
