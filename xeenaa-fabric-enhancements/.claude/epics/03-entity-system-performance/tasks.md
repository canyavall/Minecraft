# Epic: Entity System Performance Improvements

## Epic Overview
**Epic ID**: E003
**Priority**: Medium-High
**Estimated Effort**: 15 story points
**Business Value**: Optimize entity processing for better performance in high-entity environments

## Business Justification
Entity systems are core to Minecraft's gameplay, affecting everything from mob farms to player movement. High entity counts severely impact server TPS and client FPS. Optimizing entity processing enables servers to support larger mob farms, more complex redstone contraptions, and better performance in populated areas. This directly improves gameplay experience and server capacity.

## Success Criteria
- Reduce entity tick overhead by 15-25%
- Improve pathfinding algorithm efficiency by 30%
- Optimize entity collision detection with 20% performance gain
- Maintain full entity behavior compatibility
- Support higher entity counts without TPS degradation

## Performance Metrics
**Baseline Measurement Requirements**:
- Entity tick processing time per entity type
- Pathfinding computation time and success rate
- Collision detection performance with varying entity counts
- Memory allocation during entity updates
- Entity culling and rendering performance

**Target Improvements**:
- Entity ticking: 15-25% faster processing
- Pathfinding: 30% reduction in computation time
- Collision detection: 20% performance improvement
- Memory allocation: 25% reduction in entity-related allocations
- Entity count scaling: Support 50% more entities at same TPS
