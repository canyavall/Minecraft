# Epic 03: Entity System Performance Improvements

**Created**: 2025
**Status**: PLANNING
**Priority**: Medium-High

## Business Value

Entity systems are core to Minecraft's gameplay, affecting everything from mob farms to player movement. High entity counts severely impact server TPS and client FPS. Optimizing entity processing enables servers to support larger mob farms, more complex redstone contraptions, and better performance in populated areas. This directly improves gameplay experience and server capacity.

**Target audience**: Mob farm builders, server administrators, technical Minecraft players

## Overview

Optimize entity processing, pathfinding algorithms, and collision detection to dramatically improve performance in high-entity environments. Focus on enabling servers to support 50% more entities at the same TPS while maintaining full entity behavior compatibility.

## Features

### Feature 1: Optimized Entity Ticking
**Description**: Faster entity processing with reduced CPU overhead for all entity types.

**User Experience**:
- Smooth performance in mob farms
- Better TPS in populated areas
- Less lag from massive mob spawners
- Improved server capacity for entities

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 15-25% faster entity tick processing
- [ ] Support 50% more entities at same TPS
- [ ] Full entity behavior compatibility

### Feature 2: Efficient Pathfinding
**Description**: Optimized pathfinding algorithms for faster and smarter mob navigation.

**User Experience**:
- Mobs navigate terrain more efficiently
- Less CPU usage from pathfinding
- Better performance in complex structures
- Smooth mob movement

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 30% reduction in pathfinding computation time
- [ ] Improved pathfinding success rate
- [ ] Reduced memory allocations

### Feature 3: Optimized Collision Detection
**Description**: Faster collision detection for entities with 20% performance improvement.

**User Experience**:
- Smooth entity interactions
- Better performance with many entities
- Responsive collision physics
- No entity glitching

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 20% faster collision detection
- [ ] Scales well with entity count
- [ ] No behavior regressions

## Performance Targets

**Entity Ticking**: 15-25% faster
**Pathfinding**: 30% reduction in computation time
**Collision Detection**: 20% performance improvement
**Memory Allocations**: 25% reduction
**Entity Scaling**: Support 50% more entities at same TPS

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic-Level)

- [ ] All performance targets met
- [ ] Full entity behavior compatibility
- [ ] No gameplay regressions
- [ ] Performance validated with high entity counts
