# Epic: Resource Loading and Caching System

## Epic Overview
**Epic ID**: E006
**Priority**: Medium-Low
**Estimated Effort**: 10 story points
**Business Value**: Improve mod loading times and resource management

## Business Justification
Resource loading optimization directly impacts game startup time, world loading speed, and runtime performance. Intelligent caching reduces disk I/O, improves asset access times, and enables better performance for players with slower storage devices. These optimizations enhance the overall user experience and reduce wait times during gameplay.

## Success Criteria
- Reduce mod initialization time by 20-30%
- Implement intelligent caching for frequently accessed resources
- Optimize texture and model loading performance by 25%
- Maintain compatibility with resource packs and mods
- Reduce disk I/O during gameplay by 20%

## Performance Metrics
**Baseline Measurement Requirements**:
- Mod initialization and resource loading times
- Disk I/O operations during gameplay
- Memory usage for cached resources
- Asset access frequency and patterns
- Resource pack loading and switching performance

**Target Improvements**:
- Initialization time: 20-30% faster mod loading
- Disk I/O: 20% reduction in disk operations during gameplay
- Asset loading: 25% faster texture and model loading
- Cache efficiency: >85% hit rate for frequently accessed resources
- Memory usage: Controlled cache growth with intelligent eviction
