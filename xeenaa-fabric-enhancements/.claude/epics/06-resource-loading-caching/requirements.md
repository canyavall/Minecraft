# Epic 06: Resource Loading and Caching System

**Created**: 2025
**Status**: PLANNING
**Priority**: Medium-Low

## Business Value

Resource loading optimization directly impacts game startup time, world loading speed, and runtime performance. Intelligent caching reduces disk I/O, improves asset access times, and enables better performance for players with slower storage devices. These optimizations enhance the overall user experience and reduce wait times during gameplay.

**Target audience**: Modpack users, players with slow storage, resource pack users

## Overview

Optimize resource loading, implement intelligent caching for frequently accessed assets, and reduce disk I/O during gameplay. Focus on reducing mod initialization time by 20-30% while maintaining full compatibility with resource packs and mods.

## Features

### Feature 1: Intelligent Resource Caching
**Description**: Smart caching system for frequently accessed resources like textures and models.

**User Experience**:
- Faster resource loading
- Reduced wait times
- Smoother resource pack switching
- Better performance on HDD

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] >85% cache hit rate for frequent resources
- [ ] 25% faster texture/model loading
- [ ] Controlled memory growth

### Feature 2: Optimized Mod Initialization
**Description**: Faster mod loading during game startup.

**User Experience**:
- 20-30% faster game startup
- Less waiting on mod loading screen
- Quicker world loading
- Better modpack support

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 20-30% faster mod initialization
- [ ] Reduced startup time
- [ ] Full mod compatibility

### Feature 3: Reduced Disk I/O
**Description**: Minimize disk operations during gameplay through intelligent caching.

**User Experience**:
- Smoother gameplay on slow storage
- Less lag from disk access
- Better SSD/HDD performance
- Responsive asset loading

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 20% reduction in disk I/O during gameplay
- [ ] Faster world loading
- [ ] Improved cache efficiency

## Performance Targets

**Initialization Time**: 20-30% faster
**Disk I/O**: 20% reduction
**Asset Loading**: 25% faster
**Cache Hit Rate**: >85%
**Resource Pack Compatibility**: Full

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic-Level)

- [ ] All performance targets met
- [ ] Full resource pack/mod compatibility
- [ ] Memory usage controlled
- [ ] Performance validated on HDD and SSD
