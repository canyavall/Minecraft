# Epic 04: Network/Multiplayer Optimization

**Created**: 2025
**Status**: PLANNING
**Priority**: Medium

## Business Value

Network optimization directly impacts multiplayer experience quality, server bandwidth costs, and player connection stability. Reducing packet overhead improves gameplay responsiveness, reduces server hosting costs, and enables better performance for players with limited internet connections. Essential for competitive multiplayer and large server communities.

**Target audience**: Multiplayer servers, competitive players, high-latency connections

## Overview

Optimize network packet handling, compression, and synchronization to reduce bandwidth usage and improve multiplayer responsiveness. Focus on reducing packet overhead by 10-20% while maintaining full vanilla protocol compatibility.

## Features

### Feature 1: Packet Compression and Batching
**Description**: Reduce network overhead through intelligent packet batching and compression.

- Reduced lag in multiplayer
- Smooth gameplay at higher latencies

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 10-20% reduction in packet overhead
- [ ] Improved packet batching
- [ ] Better compression ratios

### Feature 2: Improved Client-Server Synchronization
**Description**: Faster and more efficient state synchronization between clients and server.

**User Experience**:
- Responsive multiplayer interactions
- Less desync issues
- Better hit registration
- Smooth multiplayer experience

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 25% faster state synchronization
- [ ] Reduced synchronization latency
