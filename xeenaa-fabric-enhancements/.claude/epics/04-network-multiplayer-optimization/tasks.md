- Minimize bandwidth usage for common operations by 15%
- Maintain full protocol compatibility with vanilla clients
- Reduce network-related lag in high-player scenarios

## Performance Metrics
**Baseline Measurement Requirements**:
- Packet count and size for common multiplayer operations
- Network latency impact on gameplay responsiveness
- Bandwidth usage per player in various scenarios
- Synchronization accuracy and timing measurements
- Packet loss handling and recovery performance

**Target Improvements**:
- Packet overhead: 10-20% reduction in packet count/size
- Sync efficiency: 25% faster state synchronization
- Bandwidth usage: 15% reduction for common operations
- Latency tolerance: Better performance with 150ms+ latency
- Connection stability: Improved packet loss recovery
