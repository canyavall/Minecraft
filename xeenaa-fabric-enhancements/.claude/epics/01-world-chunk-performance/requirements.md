# Epic 01: World/Chunk Performance Enhancements

**Created**: 2025
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: High

## Business Value

World and chunk operations are among the most CPU and memory-intensive operations in Minecraft servers. Optimizing these systems directly impacts server TPS (ticks per second), player experience, and server hosting costs. Performance improvements in this area benefit all users and enable servers to support more concurrent players.

**Target audience**: Multiplayer server administrators, modpack creators, performance-conscious players

## Overview

Optimize world loading, chunk management, and related data structures to significantly improve server performance and reduce memory usage. This epic focuses on measurable, data-driven optimizations that maintain 100% compatibility with vanilla chunk format while delivering substantial performance gains.

## Features

### Feature 1: Comprehensive Performance Monitoring
**Description**: Establish baseline metrics and real-time monitoring infrastructure to measure optimization impact accurately.

**User Experience**:
- Server administrators can see real-time chunk loading performance
- Automated performance regression detection
- Clear performance metrics dashboard
- Benchmarking tools for before/after comparisons

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Spark profiler integrated with live monitoring
- [ ] JMH benchmarking framework established
- [ ] Baseline performance documented across hardware tiers
- [ ] Automated performance alerts functional

### Feature 2: Chunk Loading Optimization
**Description**: Reduce chunk loading time through caching, parallel processing, and data structure optimization.

**User Experience**:
- Faster world exploration (less waiting for chunks to load)
- Smoother gameplay when moving through terrain
- Reduced lag spikes during chunk loading
- Better server TPS during high chunk load

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 15-25% reduction in chunk loading time
- [ ] Improved TPS stability during chunk operations
- [ ] No data corruption or chunk errors
- [ ] Vanilla chunk format compatibility maintained

### Feature 3: Memory Usage Reduction
**Description**: Optimize chunk data structures and caching to reduce server memory footprint.

**User Experience**:
- Servers can host more players with same RAM
- Reduced hosting costs for server administrators
- Less frequent garbage collection pauses
- Better performance on lower-end hardware

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 10-20% reduction in memory usage per loaded chunk
- [ ] 15% reduction in memory allocations per second
- [ ] Improved garbage collection performance
- [ ] No memory leaks or corruption

### Feature 4: I/O Operation Optimization
**Description**: Minimize disk I/O operations and improve read/write efficiency for chunk data.

**User Experience**:
- Faster world saves
- Reduced server lag during auto-save
- Better performance on slower storage (HDD)
- Smoother chunk loading from disk

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Reduced I/O operations per chunk load/save
- [ ] Faster chunk serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Optimized compression for chunk data
- [ ] Better SSD/HDD performance

## Game Mechanics

### Performance Targets
**Chunk Loading Time**: 15-25% faster (baseline: 100-150ms on Tier 2 hardware)
**Memory Usage**: 10-20% reduction per loaded chunk
**TPS Stability**: <5% variation during chunk operations
**Memory Allocations**: 15% reduction in allocations/second

### Hardware Tiers (Testing)
- **Tier 1**: High-end server (16+ cores, 32+ GB RAM, NVMe SSD)
- **Tier 2**: Mid-range server (8 cores, 16 GB RAM, SATA SSD)
- **Tier 3**: Budget/home server (4 cores, 8 GB RAM, HDD)

### Measurement Methodology
- Spark profiler with 2ms sampling interval
- JMH benchmarks for micro-optimizations
- Real-world server load testing
- Multi-tier hardware validation

## Technical Considerations

- Must maintain vanilla chunk format compatibility
- Zero tolerance for data corruption
- All optimizations must be measurable
- Performance gains validated across hardware tiers
- Fabric API compatibility required

## Dependencies

- Spark profiler integration
- JMH benchmarking framework
- Access to Tier 1/2/3 test hardware
- Vanilla chunk format specification

## Out of Scope

- Custom chunk formats (must stay vanilla-compatible)
- Client-side chunk rendering optimizations (separate epic)
- World generation optimizations (separate concern)
- Modded dimension chunk handling (vanilla only)

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic-Level)

- [ ] Baseline performance documented across all hardware tiers
- [ ] Chunk loading time reduced by 15-25%
- [ ] Memory usage per chunk reduced by 10-20%
- [ ] TPS stability improved (<5% variation during chunk ops)
- [ ] Memory allocation rate reduced by 15%
- [ ] Zero data corruption in all tests
- [ ] Vanilla chunk format compatibility maintained
- [ ] Performance gains validated on Tier 1, 2, and 3 hardware
- [ ] All optimizations backed by benchmark data
- [ ] Regression testing prevents performance degradation

## Performance Validation

All optimizations must demonstrate measurable improvement through:
1. JMH micro-benchmarks (before/after comparison)
2. Spark profiler analysis (real-world performance)
3. Multi-tier hardware testing (scalability validation)
4. Automated regression detection (CI/CD integration)

**Epic Requirement**: If an optimization cannot show measurable performance improvement with statistical significance, it is not accepted.
