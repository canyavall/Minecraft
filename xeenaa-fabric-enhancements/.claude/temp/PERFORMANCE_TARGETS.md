# Performance Targets for Xeenaa Fabric Enhancements

## Target Performance Improvements

Based on industry standards and successful Minecraft optimization mods, these are realistic and measurable targets:

### 🎯 Primary Targets

#### Chunk Loading Performance
- **Target**: 15-25% faster chunk loading
- **Baseline**: Measure vanilla chunk load time
- **Success Metric**: Consistent improvement across different world types
- **Measurement**: Average time from chunk request to chunk ready

#### Memory Usage Optimization
- **Target**: 10-20% reduction in memory usage
- **Baseline**: Heap usage during normal gameplay
- **Success Metric**: Lower peak memory, fewer GC events
- **Measurement**: JVM heap utilization over time

#### Server TPS Stability
- **Target**: Maintain 20 TPS under higher load
- **Baseline**: TPS with vanilla under stress test
- **Success Metric**: More consistent TPS, fewer lag spikes
- **Measurement**: TPS variance and minimum TPS values

### 📊 Specific Metrics

#### Chunk-Related Metrics
```

Chunks loaded per second  | X/sec    | X*1.2/sec | Timer measurement
Memory per chunk          | X MB     | X*0.9 MB  | JOL memory analysis
```

#### Memory Metrics
```
Metric                    | Baseline | Target    | Measurement Method
--------------------------|----------|-----------|------------------
Heap usage peak           | X GB     | X*0.9 GB  | JVM monitoring
GC frequency              | X/min    | X*0.8/min | GC logs
Object allocation rate    | X MB/s   | X*0.85 MB/s| Micrometer
```

#### Server Performance
```
Metric                    | Baseline | Target    | Measurement Method
--------------------------|----------|-----------|------------------
Average TPS               | X        | ≥19.5     | Server tick measurement
MSPT (ms per tick)        | X ms     | <45ms     | Tick duration tracking
Lag spike frequency       | X/hour   | X*0.5/hour| TPS variance analysis
```
