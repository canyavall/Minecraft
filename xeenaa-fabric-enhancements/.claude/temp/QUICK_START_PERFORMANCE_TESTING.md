# Quick Start: Confirming Performance Improvements

## üöÄ Immediate Steps to Measure Performance

### Step 1: Build and Test Current Setup
```bash
# Build your mod
./gradlew build

# The JAR will be in build/libs/
```

### Step 2: Run Baseline Test (BEFORE optimizations)
```bash
# Option A: Quick test with current setup
./gradlew runServer

# Option B: Use the testing script
scripts/quick_performance_test.bat
```

### Step 3: Install Spark Profiler (Recommended)
1. Download Spark for Fabric 1.21.1 from https://spark.lucko.me/download
2. Place in your `mods/` folder alongside your mod
3. Start server and run: `/spark profiler --timeout 120`

### Step 4: Measure Key Metrics

#### In-Game Commands for Quick Testing:
```
/debug start              # Start Minecraft's built-in profiler
# ... perform test actions ...
/debug stop               # Stop and save profile

# With Spark:
/spark profiler start
# ... run your performance test ...
/spark profiler stop
```

#### Test Scenarios to Run:
1. **Chunk Loading Test**: Fly in creative mode for 5 minutes straight
2. **World Loading Test**: Teleport to 10 different locations
3. **Memory Test**: Monitor heap usage during gameplay

### Step 5: Record Baseline Numbers

Create a file `baseline_results.txt` with:
```
=== BASELINE PERFORMANCE (Before Optimizations) ===
Date: [Today's date]
Test Duration: [X minutes]

Results:
- Average TPS: ___
- Minimum TPS: ___
- Average chunk load time: ___ ms
- Peak memory usage: ___ MB
- Chunks loaded: ___
- Any lag spikes? Yes/No

Notes:
[Any observations about performance]
```

### Step 6: Implement Your Optimization

Make your performance changes (chunk loading, memory optimization, etc.)

### Step 7: Re-test with Same Conditions

Run identical tests and record results in `optimized_results.txt`

### Step 8: Compare Results

Use the built-in comparison tool:
```java
// In your mod code
PerformanceComparator.ComparisonReport report =
    PerformanceComparator.compare(baselineResults, optimizedResults);
String reportText = PerformanceComparator.generateReport(report);
System.out.println(reportText);
```

## üìä What Numbers to Look For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- **Chunk loading**: 15-25% faster
- **Memory usage**: 10-20% reduction
- **TPS stability**: Fewer lag spikes, higher minimum TPS
- **Consistent improvement**: Results are repeatable

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signs:
- **Inconsistent results**: Performance varies widely between tests
- **Marginal improvement**: <5% improvement (might be measurement noise)
- **Trade-offs**: One metric improves but others get worse

### ‚ùå Regression Indicators:
- **Slower performance**: Any metric becomes worse
- **Crashes or instability**: Mod causes game issues
- **Memory leaks**: Memory usage grows over time

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Optimization Ideas to Test

### Easy Wins (Start Here):
1. **Chunk caching**: Cache frequently accessed chunks
2. **Memory pooling**: Reuse objects instead of creating new ones
3. **Lazy loading**: Only load data when actually needed

### Medium Difficulty:
1. **Parallel processing**: Use multiple threads for chunk operations
2. **Data structure optimization**: Use more efficient collections
3. **Algorithm improvements**: Better chunk loading algorithms

### Advanced:
1. **JVM tuning**: Optimize garbage collection settings
2. **Native optimizations**: Use specialized libraries
3. **Async operations**: Move blocking operations off main thread

## üìà Expected Improvement Ranges

Based on successful Minecraft optimization mods:

| Optimization Type | Typical Improvement | Excellent Result |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Chunk Loading    | 10-20%            | 25-40%           |
| Memory Usage     | 5-15%             | 20-30%           |
| TPS Stability    | Fewer lag spikes  | Consistent 20 TPS |
| Overall Performance | 5-10%           | 15-25%           |

## üîç Debugging Poor Results

If you don't see improvements:

1. **Verify measurement**: Are you testing the right thing?
2. **Check bottlenecks**: Use profiler to find real performance issues
3. **Test environment**: Is your test consistent and realistic?
4. **Code review**: Is your optimization actually being executed?
5. **Incremental approach**: Test one optimization at a time

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Document everything**: Keep detailed records of what you tried
2. **Share results**: Post your findings to help the community
3. **Iterate**: Continue optimizing based on profiler results
4. **Validate**: Test with real players in real scenarios

Remember: **Measure twice, optimize once**. Always confirm your optimizations actually work with real data, not just theory!
