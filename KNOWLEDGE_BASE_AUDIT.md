# Knowledge Base Audit & Migration Report

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Audited By**: research-agent
**Scope**: All projects in workspace

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **Audit Complete**: Scanned all project folders for universal knowledge that should be in centralized knowledge base.

**Key Findings**:
- 3 universal knowledge files already migrated (villagers, porting, profiling)
- 1 major new knowledge file created (Alex's Mobs reference)
- Most project research is correctly project-specific (should remain in projects)
- Reference files created to point to centralized knowledge

### Knowledge Index

**File**: `.claude/knowledge/knowledge-index.json`
**Status**: ✅ Updated with all 4 entries
**Tags**: Properly categorized for discovery

---

## Project-Specific Research (Correctly Placed)

### xeena-village-manager

**Research Files**: 11 files
**Status**: ✅ Correctly project-specific

**Universal knowledge already migrated**:
- Villager systems → centralized knowledge
- Guard-specific implementation remains in project

**Key Project Files**:
- `villager-systems-reference.md` - Points to centralized knowledge + project notes
- Guard implementation research (bed claiming fix, zombification, combat animations)

### xeenaa-fabric-enhancements

**Research Files**: Multiple research docs + performance baselines
**Status**: ✅ Correctly project-specific

**Universal knowledge already migrated**:
- Performance profiling tools → centralized knowledge

**Key Project Files**:
- Project-specific performance baselines
- Mod inventory and configuration
- Integration recommendations for THIS project

### xeenaa-structure-manager

**Research Files**: ~15 files in research/
**Status**: ✅ Correctly project-specific

**Content**: Deep dive into structure generation performance
- STRUCTURE_START stage analysis
- Jigsaw structure bottlenecks
- Placement tracking research
- Log analysis and profiling results

**Why project-specific**: Highly specialized research on structure generation optimization. Not general-purpose enough for centralized knowledge.

### xeenaa-alexs-mobs

**Epic 002 Documentation**: Comprehensive mob catalog in epic folder
**Status**: ✅ Universal knowledge extracted

**What was extracted**:
- High-level mob reference catalog → centralized knowledge
- Asset patterns and porting estimates → centralized knowledge

**What remains in project** (correctly):
- `CATALOG.md` - Detailed per-mob breakdown (1700+ lines)
- `ASSET_INVENTORY.md` - Exhaustive asset listing
- `COMPLEXITY_ANALYSIS.md` - Deep mechanics analysis
- Extracted JAR and assets
- Project-specific porting strategy

**Reference file created**: `alexs-mobs-reference.md` points to centralized knowledge

---

## Files Created During Audit

### New Knowledge Files

1. **`.claude/knowledge/minecraft/alexs-mobs-reference.md`**
   - Complete reference catalog of Alex's Mobs creatures
   - Universal resource for anyone porting entity-heavy mods
   - Follows knowledge base writing standards

### New Reference Files

2. **`xeenaa-alexs-mobs/.claude/research/alexs-mobs-reference.md`**
   - Points to centralized knowledge
   - Explains when to use centralized vs project-specific docs
   - Quick reference summary

3. **`KNOWLEDGE_BASE_AUDIT.md`** (this file)
   - Audit results and recommendations
   - Workspace-level documentation

---

## Recommendations

### ✅ No Further Migration Needed

**Reason**: All universal knowledge has been identified and either:
1. Already migrated (villagers, profiling, porting)
2. Newly extracted (Alex's Mobs reference)
3. Correctly remaining in projects (project-specific research)

### ✅ Reference Files in Place

Projects with migrated knowledge now have reference files pointing to centralized knowledge:
- `xeena-village-manager/.claude/research/villager-systems-reference.md`
- `xeenaa-alexs-mobs/.claude/research/alexs-mobs-reference.md`
- `xeenaa-alexs-mobs/.claude/research/porting-reference.md`
- `xeenaa-fabric-enhancements/.claude/research/performance-reference.md`

### Future Maintenance

**When adding new projects**:
1. Check if research applies to multiple projects
2. If yes, add to `.claude/knowledge/` with proper tags
3. Create reference file in project pointing to centralized knowledge
4. Update `knowledge-index.json`

**When conducting research**:
1. Start in project-specific research folder
2. After completion, evaluate if knowledge is universal
3. If universal, migrate to centralized knowledge following WRITING_STANDARDS.md
4. Keep project-specific details in project, reference universal knowledge

## Knowledge Discovery Guide

### For Agents

**To find knowledge on a topic**:
1. Search `.claude/knowledge/knowledge-index.json` by tags
2. Read referenced knowledge file
3. Check "related" field for connected topics

**To add new knowledge**:
1. Follow `.claude/knowledge/WRITING_STANDARDS.md`
2. Create file in appropriate category
3. Add entry to `knowledge-index.json`
4. Link related knowledge files

### For Users

**Common search patterns**:
```bash
# Find entity-related knowledge
grep -r "entities" .claude/knowledge/knowledge-index.json

# Find profiling knowledge
grep -r "profiling" .claude/knowledge/knowledge-index.json

# Find porting knowledge
grep -r "porting" .claude/knowledge/knowledge-index.json
```

**Browse by category**:
- `minecraft/` - Minecraft core systems
- `performance/` - Optimization and profiling
- `libraries/` - Third-party libraries and tools
- `fabric-api/` - Fabric API specifics (to be added as needed)
- `graphics/` - Rendering and animations (to be added as needed)

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Knowledge base is well-organized** with clear separation between:
- **Universal knowledge** (centralized, reusable)
- **Project-specific research** (in projects, detailed)
- **Reference files** (linking the two)

✅ **No redundant knowledge** found. Each project's research is appropriately scoped.

✅ **Alex's Mobs reference** successfully extracted as major new universal knowledge resource.

**The knowledge base is now a single source of truth for universal Minecraft modding knowledge across all projects in this workspace.**

**Audit Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Next Action**: Continue project work with improved knowledge organization
