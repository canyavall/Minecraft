# TASK-006 Summary: Strategic Epic Breakdown

**Task**: Group Mobs for Epic Planning (FINAL TASK OF PHASE 2)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed**: 2025-10-26
**Agent**: research-agent

---

## Objective

Organize the remaining 87 mobs (90 total minus Epic 03's 3) into logical groups for Epic 04 through Epic 15, creating a strategic porting roadmap for the entire Alex's Mobs Fabric port.

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Epic Summary Table

Created a comprehensive epic breakdown with 12 epics (Epic 03-15) covering all 87 remaining mobs:

| Phase | Epics | Mob Count | Weeks | Complexity |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Simple | 03-06 | 25 mobs | 7-12 weeks | Simple AI |
| Medium | 07-10 | 29 mobs | 12-16 weeks | Medium AI |
| Complex | 11-13 | 20 mobs | 16-19 weeks | Complex AI |
| Very Complex | 14-15 | 7 mobs | 16-20 weeks | Very Complex |
| **TOTAL** | **12 epics** | **87 mobs** | **60-75 weeks** | **All tiers** |

**Total Project Duration**: 14-18 months for full port (excluding bosses)

---

### 2. Detailed Epic Breakdowns

Each epic includes:
- **Mob List**: Specific mobs with rationale for grouping
- **Complexity Mix**: AI goals, animation counts, special features
- **Rationale**: Why these mobs belong together (code reuse, biome theme, behavior patterns)
- **Movement Types**: Flying, swimming, land, amphibious, lava-striding
- **Special Features**: Unique mechanics per epic
- **Estimated Effort**: S/M/L/XL with hour ranges
- **Dependencies**: Sequential epic dependencies
- **Technical Focus**: New systems introduced in each epic

---

### 3. Grouping Criteria (Multi-Dimensional)

Mobs organized using **5 criteria**:

1. **Complexity** (primary): Simple → Medium → Complex → Very Complex
2. **Movement Type**: Flying, swimming, land, amphibious, lava-striding, wall-climbing
3. **Biome/Dimension**: Overworld, Nether, End, Deep Dark, specific biomes
4. **Behavior**: Passive, neutral, defensive, hostile, placatable, tameable
5. **Code/Asset Reuse**: Shared AI patterns, similar rigs, equipment systems

---

### 4. Strategic Highlights

#### Phase 1: Simple Mobs (Epic 03-06) - 25 mobs
- **Goal**: Validate framework, establish templates
- **Focus**: Basic AI (wander, flee, swim, fly)
- **Popular Mobs**: Blue Jay, Hummingbird
- **Duration**: 7-12 weeks

#### Phase 2: Medium Mobs (Epic 07-10) - 29 mobs
- **Goal**: Taming, items, environmental variants
- **Focus**: Medium AI, transformations, placatable mechanics
- **Popular Mobs**: Crow, Raccoon, Sugar Glider
- **Duration**: 12-16 weeks

#### Phase 3: Complex Mobs (Epic 11-13) - 20 mobs
- **Goal**: Riding, equipment, social AI
- **Focus**: Advanced mechanics, large creatures
- **Popular Mobs**: Grizzly Bear, Tiger, Elephant (partial)
- **Duration**: 16-19 weeks

#### Phase 4: Very Complex (Epic 14-15) - 7 mobs
- **Goal**: Multi-part entities, inventory, boss mechanics
- **Focus**: Capstone achievements, most advanced systems
- **Featured**: Elephant, Bone Serpent, Cave Centipede, Farseer, Cachalot Whale
- **Duration**: 16-20 weeks

---

### 5. Code Reuse Opportunities

**Identified reusable patterns**:
- **Basic Wander/Flee**: 14 mobs (Epic 03-06)
- **Flying AI**: 6 mobs (Epic 04) → reused in Epic 07, 11, 13
- **Swimming AI**: 13 mobs (Epic 05, 08) → reused in Epic 13, 14, 15
- **Tameable Pattern**: 5 mobs (Epic 07, 11)
- **Placatable Pattern**: 10 mobs (Epic 09, 11, 14)
- **Rideable Pattern**: 7 mobs (Epic 11, 14)
- **Pack/Herd AI**: 4 mobs (Epic 04, 12)

**Shared Asset Types**:
- **Quadrupeds**: 7 mobs (reuse 4-leg skeleton)
- **Birds**: 7 mobs (reuse wing rig, flying animations)
- **Fish**: 5 mobs (reuse fish body rig)
- **Snakes**: 3 mobs (reuse slithering animations)
- **Multi-Part**: 2 mobs (reuse segmented rendering)

---

### 6. User Engagement Strategy

**Early Popular Mobs** (Epic 04, 07):
- Blue Jay, Hummingbird (Epic 04 - weeks 3-5)
- Crow, Raccoon, Sugar Glider (Epic 07 - weeks 13-16)

**Visual Variety**:
- Each epic has diverse animal types (birds, mammals, fish, insects, reptiles)
- Mix of passive, neutral, hostile in each phase
- Different biomes represented

**Phased Delivery**:
- Users get 3-8 new mobs every 1-4 weeks
- Incremental feature rollout (taming → riding → equipment → inventory)

---

### 7. Technical Learning Path

**Incremental Complexity**:
- **Epic 03-06**: Basic AI (wander, flee, swim, fly, particles)
- **Epic 07-10**: Taming, item interaction, variants, transformations
- **Epic 11-13**: Riding, equipment, social AI, special attacks
- **Epic 14-15**: Multi-part, inventory, boss mechanics, portal systems

**Pattern Reuse Timeline**:
- Epic 04 flying AI → Epic 07 (Crow), Epic 11 (Bald Eagle)
- Epic 05 aquatic AI → Epic 08 (predators), Epic 14 (whales)
- Epic 07 taming → Epic 11 (Grizzly Bear, Tiger)
- Epic 11 riding → Epic 14 (Elephant)

**Risk Management**:
- Hardest problems tackled when framework is mature
- Simple mobs validate workflow before complex mechanics
- Each epic introduces 1-2 new systems (not overwhelming)

---

## Key Insights

### Balanced Distribution
- **Simple**: 25 mobs (29%) - Fast iterations, template creation
- **Medium**: 29 mobs (33%) - Core mechanics (taming, variants, transformations)
- **Complex**: 20 mobs (23%) - Advanced features (riding, equipment, social AI)
- **Very Complex**: 7 mobs (8%) - Capstone challenges (multi-part, inventory, bosses)

### Realistic Timeline
- **Total**: 60-75 weeks (14-18 months)
- **Phased Delivery**: Content every 1-4 weeks
- **Sustainable Pace**: 5-10 mobs per month
- **Quality Focus**: Each epic delivers polished, tested mobs

### Strategic Value
- **Early Wins**: Popular mobs (Blue Jay, Crow, Raccoon) in Phase 1-2
- **Learning Curve**: Gradual complexity increase
- **Code Reuse**: Later epics benefit from earlier work
- **User Engagement**: Regular content updates maintain interest

## Next Steps

1. **Validate Groupings**: Review epic breakdown with user/team
2. **Epic 03 Planning**: Create Epic 03 requirements.md (Proof of Concept)
3. **Framework Setup**: Complete Epic 01 (GeckoLib framework)
4. **Asset Pipeline**: Establish Blockbench → GeckoLib workflow
5. **Begin Porting**: Start Epic 03 (Fly, Cockroach, Triops)
