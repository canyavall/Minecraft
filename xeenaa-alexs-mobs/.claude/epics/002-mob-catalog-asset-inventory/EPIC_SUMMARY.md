# Epic 02 Summary: Mob Catalog & Asset Inventory

**Epic**: 02-mob-catalog-asset-inventory
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-26
**Total Tasks**: 8 (all completed)
**Total Effort**: ~20-24 hours across 7 days

---

## Executive Summary

Epic 02 successfully cataloged all 90 animal mobs from Alex's Mobs v1.22.9 (Forge/NeoForge 1.20.1), documented comprehensive asset requirements, assigned complexity ratings using a 3-dimensional framework, and created a strategic 14-18 month porting roadmap organized into 13 logical epics. The epic delivered 5 major research documents totaling 5,600+ lines of detailed analysis, providing a complete foundation for the Fabric 1.21.1 port.

**Key Achievement**: Transformed an unknown scope ("port Alex's Mobs") into a fully-scoped, sequenced, risk-mitigated 60-75 week plan with 77 animals organized by complexity and strategic value.

---

## Key Findings

### Mob Count & Distribution

**Total Mobs Cataloged**: 90 animals + 2 bosses (92 total)

**Complexity Distribution**:
- **Simple**: 30 mobs (33.3%) - 3-5 AI goals, minimal animations
- **Medium**: 35 mobs (38.9%) - 5-8 AI goals, standard animations
- **Complex**: 20 mobs (22.2%) - 8-12 AI goals, advanced features
- **Very Complex**: 7 mobs (7.8%) - 12+ AI goals, multi-part/boss/inventory

**Category Breakdown**:
- Passive: 40+ mobs (herbivores, small animals, fish)
- Neutral: 30+ mobs (defensive when provoked)
- Hostile: 20+ mobs (aggressive)
- Aquatic: 15+ mobs (water-based)
- Flying: 10+ mobs (birds, flying creatures)
- Arthropods: 8+ mobs (insects, arachnids)
- Bosses/Chiefs: 2 mobs (Void Worm, Warped Mosco)

### Asset Summary

**Total Assets Identified**:

| Asset Type | Count | Status | Effort Estimate |
|------------|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Entity Textures** | 402 PNG files | Can recreate (4.5 avg/mob) | 180-360 hours |
| **Sound Files** | 571 OGG files | Recreate (licensing unclear) | 90-180 hours |
| **Loot Tables** | 104 JSON files | Can reuse (GPL-3.0) | 22-45 hours |
| **Models** | 90 mobs | **MUST RECREATE** (Citadel → GeckoLib) | 450-700 hours |
| **Animations** | 90 mobs | **MUST RECREATE** (code-based → GeckoLib) | 540-900 hours |
| **TOTAL** | | | **1,282-2,185 hours** |

**Key Insight**: Models and animations are NOT extractable from the original mod (Citadel uses code-based system). All 90 mob models and animations must be recreated from scratch in GeckoLib format using Blockbench. This represents 990-1,600 hours (77% of asset work) and is the primary technical challenge.

**Asset Recreation Priority**:
1. ✅ **Loot Tables** - Directly reusable with minimal Forge→Fabric conversion (~22-45h)
2. ⚠️ **Textures** - Can trace/reference but recreate for legal clarity (~180-360h)
3. ⚠️ **Sounds** - Licensing unclear, recommend recreation/sourcing (~90-180h)
4. ❌ **Models** - MUST recreate entirely (~450-700h) - No source files exist
5. ❌ **Animations** - MUST recreate entirely (~540-900h) - Code-based, not extractable

## Recommended Next Steps (Epic 03 - Immediate)

### Epic 03: Proof of Concept

**Recommended Mobs** (3 ultra-simple):
1. **Fly** - Flying, passive (4 AI goals, 3 animations, 1 texture) - **SIMPLEST**
2. **Cockroach** - Land, passive (3 AI goals, 3 animations, 1 texture) - **SIMPLEST LAND**
3. **Triops** - Aquatic, passive (3 AI goals, 3 animations, 1 texture) - **SIMPLEST AQUATIC**

**Why These 3?**
- ✅ **Ultra-Simple**: Minimal AI (3-4 goals), minimal animations (3), no special features, 1 texture each
- ✅ **Movement Coverage**: Flying (Fly), Land (Cockroach), Aquatic (Triops) = full validation
- ✅ **Fast Iteration**: Can complete all 3 in 1-2 weeks (120-180 hours total)
- ✅ **Low Risk**: If GeckoLib doesn't work, we discover this early with simplest mobs
- ✅ **Workflow Proof**: Validates entire pipeline (Blockbench → GeckoLib → Fabric → spawning)

**Goals**:
- Validate GeckoLib framework with real animals
- Establish entity registration patterns (Fabric API)
- Test resource loading (textures, sounds, loot tables)
- Build porting workflow confidence
- Create reusable templates for future mobs

**Estimated Effort**: 120-180 hours (S)
- 40-60 hours per mob × 3 mobs
- Model creation: 15-20h per mob
- Animations: 15-20h per mob
- Code/testing: 10-20h per mob

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Risk**: Low (simplest possible mobs)

---

## Uncertainties & Assumptions

### Uncertainties

1. **GeckoLib Parity with Citadel**
   - **Issue**: Original mod uses Citadel (code-based animations), we're porting to GeckoLib (JSON-based)
   - **Risk**: Some Citadel animations may not translate well to GeckoLib
   - **Mitigation**: Epic 03 validates framework early, pivot if needed
   - **Status**: Will be resolved in Epic 03 (weeks 1-2)

2. **Sound Asset Licensing**
   - **Issue**: GPL-3.0 may not cover original sound files (could be third-party)
   - **Risk**: May need to recreate all 571 sounds
   - **Mitigation**: Contact original author for clarification, use royalty-free alternatives (Freesound.org)
   - **Impact**: If full recreation needed: +90-180 hours
   - **Status**: Awaiting legal review or author contact

3. **Multi-Part Entity Complexity**
   - **Issue**: Bone Serpent, Cave Centipede, Void Worm have multi-segment bodies
   - **Risk**: GeckoLib may lack robust multi-part support
   - **Mitigation**: Research existing GeckoLib multi-part examples, defer to Epic 14 (week 47) when framework is mature
   - **Impact**: If blockers found: May need custom rendering solution or defer to post-launch
   - **Status**: Deferred to Epic 14 (low priority)

4. **Performance at Scale**
   - **Issue**: 90 mobs with complex AI/animations may impact server/client performance
   - **Risk**: Lag with many entities spawned
   - **Mitigation**: Profile early (Epic 04-06), implement multithreaded pathfinding for large mobs (Elephant, Bison, etc.)
   - **Impact**: May require optimization passes between epics
   - **Status**: Will monitor during Phase 1 (weeks 1-12)

5. **Community Mod Compatibility**
   - **Issue**: Unknown interactions with other Fabric mods (biome mods, spawn control, etc.)
   - **Risk**: Spawn conflicts, AI conflicts, rendering conflicts
   - **Mitigation**: Test with popular Fabric mods during Phase 2, document conflicts
   - **Impact**: May require compatibility patches
   - **Status**: Will test during Phase 2 (weeks 13-28)

---

### Assumptions

1. **GeckoLib 4.x is Sufficient**
   - **Assumption**: GeckoLib 4.x for Fabric 1.21.1 supports all animation features needed
   - **Validation**: Epic 03 (weeks 1-2)
   - **Fallback**: If GeckoLib insufficient, evaluate alternatives (Animated Java, custom system)

2. **Fabric API is Feature-Complete**
   - **Assumption**: Fabric API provides equivalent features to Forge (entity attributes, spawning, biome modifications, recipe types)
   - **Validation**: Epic 03-04 (weeks 1-6)
   - **Fallback**: Forge features documented as Fabric gaps, implement custom solutions or defer

3. **Asset Recreation is Legal**
   - **Assumption**: GPL-3.0 permits creating new assets inspired by originals (clean-room implementation)
   - **Validation**: Legal review or contact original author
   - **Fallback**: If unclear, seek explicit permission or create fully original assets

4. **1-Person Development is Viable**
   - **Assumption**: 60-75 weeks is acceptable timeline for solo developer
   - **Validation**: User acceptance of timeline
   - **Fallback**: If timeline too long, recruit contributors or reduce scope (defer Very Complex mobs)

5. **Popular Mobs Drive Engagement**
   - **Assumption**: Delivering Crow, Raccoon, Grizzly Bear, Elephant early/mid-project maintains community interest
   - **Validation**: Community feedback during Phase 1-2
   - **Fallback**: Survey community, adjust priorities within complexity tiers

6. **Complexity Ratings are Accurate**
   - **Assumption**: 3-dimensional framework (AI + Animations + Features) accurately predicts porting difficulty
   - **Validation**: Epic 03-04 will reveal if estimates are accurate
   - **Fallback**: Adjust effort estimates based on actual Epic 03-04 results

## Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### High-Impact Risks

**1. GeckoLib Framework Inadequacy (CRITICAL)**
- **Risk**: GeckoLib cannot support complex animations (multi-part, transformations, riding)
- **Probability**: Low (10%) - GeckoLib is mature and widely used
- **Impact**: High - Would block entire port
- **Mitigation**:
  - Epic 03 validates basic GeckoLib usage (weeks 1-2)
  - Epic 04-06 validates standard animations (weeks 3-12)
  - Epic 07-10 validates taming/riding (weeks 13-28)
  - Epic 11+ validates complex features (weeks 29+)
- **Contingency**: If blocked, evaluate Animated Java or custom animation system
- **Detection**: Epic 03 (week 2)

**2. Asset Recreation Licensing Issues (HIGH)**
- **Risk**: Cannot legally recreate sounds/textures, must commission entirely new assets
- **Probability**: Medium (30%) - GPL-3.0 unclear on non-code assets
- **Impact**: Medium - Adds 100-200 hours for full recreation + commissioning costs
- **Mitigation**:
  - Contact original author (alexthe666) for guidance (immediate)
  - Use royalty-free sound libraries (Freesound.org, Epidemic Sound)
  - Document clean-room process for textures
- **Contingency**: If recreation required, budget +100-200h effort
- **Detection**: Legal review or author response (weeks 1-4)

**3. Timeline Slippage (MEDIUM)**
- **Risk**: Actual effort per mob exceeds estimates, timeline extends beyond 18 months
- **Probability**: Medium (40%) - Complexity estimates may be optimistic
- **Impact**: Medium - Delays deliverables, reduces community engagement
- **Mitigation**:
  - Track actual hours per mob in Epic 03-04 (weeks 1-6)
  - Adjust estimates based on real data
  - Prioritize popular mobs (Crow, Raccoon, Grizzly, Elephant)
  - Defer Very Complex mobs to optional Epic 16 if needed
- **Contingency**: If timeline extends, defer bosses (Void Worm, Warped Mosco) to post-launch
- **Detection**: Epic 03-04 actuals (weeks 1-6)

---

### Medium-Impact Risks

**4. Multi-Part Entity Complexity (MEDIUM)**
- **Risk**: Bone Serpent, Cave Centipede, Void Worm require custom multi-part rendering
- **Probability**: Medium (30%) - GeckoLib multi-part support is limited
- **Impact**: Medium - May block 3 mobs (Bone Serpent, Cave Centipede, Void Worm)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Research existing GeckoLib multi-part examples early (Epic 03)
  - Defer multi-part mobs to Epic 14 (week 47) when framework mature
  - Consider alternative implementation (multiple entities with sync)
- **Contingency**: If blocked, defer to post-launch or implement custom renderer
- **Detection**: Epic 14 (week 47)

**5. Performance Degradation (MEDIUM)**
- **Risk**: 90 mobs with complex AI cause lag on servers/clients
- **Probability**: Medium (35%) - Many mobs with pathfinding can impact TPS
- **Impact**: Medium - User experience degradation, negative feedback
- **Mitigation**:
  - Profile early and often (every epic)
  - Implement multithreaded pathfinding for large mobs (Elephant, Bison, Gorilla)
  - Optimize AI goal execution (cooldowns, range checks)
  - Provide config options (disable mobs, adjust spawn rates)
- **Contingency**: Add performance optimization epic between phases if needed
- **Detection**: Phase 1 profiling (weeks 1-12)

**6. Community Contribution Variability (LOW-MEDIUM)**
- **Risk**: If accepting contributions, quality/style may be inconsistent
- **Probability**: Medium (if contributions accepted)
- **Impact**: Low-Medium - Requires review time, potential rework
- **Mitigation**:
  - Establish clear contribution guidelines (model style, animation quality, code standards)
  - Create Blockbench templates for consistency
  - Review all contributions before merge
  - Solo development avoids this risk entirely
- **Contingency**: Politely reject low-quality contributions, provide feedback
- **Detection**: Ongoing if contributions accepted

---

### Low-Impact Risks

**7. Biome Mod Compatibility (LOW)**
- **Risk**: Spawn rules conflict with biome mods (Terralith, Biomes O' Plenty)
- **Probability**: Low (20%) - Fabric's biome API is robust
- **Impact**: Low - Affects specific mod combinations only
- **Mitigation**: Test with popular biome mods during Phase 2, document spawn tag usage
- **Contingency**: Provide compatibility configs or patches
- **Detection**: Phase 2 testing (weeks 13-28)

**8. Minecraft Version Instability (LOW)**
- **Risk**: Minecraft 1.21.1 has breaking bugs or Fabric updates break compatibility
- **Probability**: Low (15%) - Minecraft 1.21.1 is stable as of 2025-10
- **Impact**: Low - May require mod updates
- **Mitigation**: Pin Fabric API versions, test updates before adopting
- **Contingency**: Provide multiple mod versions for different Fabric API versions
- **Detection**: Ongoing

## Recommendations for Epic 03 (Immediate Next Steps)

### 1. Begin Epic 03 Planning

**Actions**:
1. Create `03-proof-of-concept/requirements.md` (business goals, game mechanics)
2. Create `03-proof-of-concept/plan.md` (technical tasks breakdown)
3. Review Epic 03 mob choices with user (Fly, Cockroach, Triops)

**Priority**: HIGH (blocking all future work)
**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours (planning only)

---

### 2. Resolve Asset Licensing

**Actions**:
1. Contact original author (alexthe666) via:
   - Email (if available)
   - CurseForge comments
   - GitHub issues
   - Discord (Alex's Mobs Discord server)
2. Ask for clarification:
   - Can we recreate textures/sounds in similar style?
   - Is attribution sufficient?
   - Any concerns about Fabric port?
3. Document response for legal record

**Priority**: HIGH (may add 100-200 hours if full recreation required)
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (initial contact), waiting period

---

### 3. Set Up GeckoLib Development Environment

**Actions**:
1. Install Blockbench with GeckoLib plugin
2. Review GeckoLib 4.x documentation
3. Create test GeckoLib model (simple cube with animation)
4. Test GeckoLib model in Minecraft 1.21.1 Fabric
5. Validate GeckoLib workflow before starting Epic 03

**Priority**: CRITICAL (blocking Epic 03 start)
**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours (one-time setup)

---

### 4. Create Asset Recreation Pipeline

**Actions**:
1. Set up Blockbench templates (quadruped, biped, fish, bird, insect)
2. Research royalty-free sound sources (Freesound.org, Epidemic Sound)
3. Set up texture recreation workflow (Aseprite, GIMP, or Paint.NET)
4. Document asset creation standards (model style, texture resolution, sound quality)

**Priority**: MEDIUM (can be done in parallel with Epic 03)
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours (one-time setup)

---

### 5. Establish Tracking & Metrics

**Actions**:
1. Create time tracking spreadsheet (actual hours per mob)
2. Track Epic 03 actual vs. estimated effort
3. Adjust future estimates based on Epic 03 data
4. Document lessons learned after Epic 03

**Priority**: MEDIUM (improves future planning)
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (ongoing tracking)

---

## Long-Term Recommendations

### 1. Community Engagement Strategy

**Suggestions**:
- Create Discord server or subreddit for development updates
- Post Epic 03 completion announcement (first 3 mobs ported)
- Survey community for most-wanted mobs (validate roadmap priorities)
- Accept contributions (models, textures, sounds) with clear guidelines
- Regular dev blogs (bi-weekly or monthly updates)

**Benefits**: Maintains interest, gathers feedback, potential contributors

---

### 2. Code Reuse & Templating

**Suggestions**:
- Create base entity classes by movement type (FlyingAnimalEntity, AquaticAnimalEntity, LandAnimalEntity)
- Create AI goal templates (FollowOwnerGoal, GatherItemsGoal, HerdBehaviorGoal)
- Create animation templates (walk, run, idle, attack, death)
- Build Blockbench templates (quadruped, biped, fish, bird, insect)
- Document code patterns (wiki or PATTERNS.md)

**Benefits**: Reduces per-mob effort, improves consistency, easier onboarding

---

### 3. Performance Optimization Plan

**Suggestions**:
- Profile after Epic 04-06 (25 simple mobs)
- Implement multithreaded pathfinding for large mobs (Elephant, Bison, Gorilla)
- Optimize AI goal execution (cooldowns, range checks, entity tracking)
- Provide config options (disable mobs, adjust spawn rates, pathfinding budget)
- Test on low-end hardware (ensure broad compatibility)

**Benefits**: Prevents performance issues, improves user experience

---

### 4. Quality Assurance Process

**Suggestions**:
- Create per-mob QA checklist (spawning, AI, animations, sounds, loot, no crashes)
- Test each mob in survival mode (not just creative)
- Test mob interactions (predator/prey, social hierarchy, taming)
- Test with popular Fabric mods (biome mods, spawn control, optimization mods)
- Beta test each epic with community before marking complete

**Benefits**: Catches bugs early, ensures quality, builds trust

## Key Takeaways for User

### What We Learned

1. **Scope is Massive**: 90 animals + 2 bosses = 2,160-3,580 hours (1.1-1.8 person-years)
2. **Asset Recreation is Biggest Challenge**: Models/animations must be recreated from scratch (990-1,600 hours, 77% of asset work)
3. **Phased Approach is Essential**: Simple → Medium → Complex → Very Complex reduces risk and builds confidence
4. **Popular Mobs Early/Mid-Project**: Delivering Crow, Raccoon (week 16), Grizzly Bear (week 34), Elephant (week 55) maintains engagement
5. **Epic 03 is Critical**: Proof of concept (weeks 1-2) validates GeckoLib and establishes workflow

---

### What's Ready

1. ✅ **Complete Mob Catalog**: All 90 animals documented with complexity ratings
2. ✅ **Asset Inventory**: Per-mob asset breakdown with recreation strategy
3. ✅ **Porting Roadmap**: 13 epics with 77 mobs over 60-75 weeks
4. ✅ **Epic 03 Recommendations**: 3 ultra-simple mobs identified (Fly, Cockroach, Triops)
5. ✅ **Risk Assessment**: All major risks identified with mitigation strategies

---

### What's Next

**Immediate (Week 1)**:
1. **User Decision**: Approve Epic 03 mob choices (Fly, Cockroach, Triops)
2. **Create Epic 03 Requirements**: Business goals, game mechanics design

## Conclusion

Epic 02 successfully transformed an ambiguous goal ("port Alex's Mobs") into a fully-scoped, sequenced, risk-mitigated 60-75 week plan. The epic delivered 5 comprehensive research documents totaling 5,600+ lines of analysis, providing complete visibility into the 90-animal port.

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Cataloged all 90 animals with complexity ratings
- ✅ Documented 402 textures, 571 sounds, 104 loot tables, 90 models/animations
- ✅ Created strategic 13-epic roadmap (77 mobs over 60-75 weeks)
- ✅ Identified 3 ultra-simple mobs for Epic 03 proof of concept
- ✅ Validated all deliverables against extracted JAR
- ✅ Risk-assessed entire port (8 major risks identified with mitigations)

**Biggest Insight**: Model and animation recreation is the primary challenge (990-1,600 hours, 77% of asset work) because Citadel uses code-based system with no extractable files. All 90 mob models and animations must be recreated from scratch in GeckoLib format using Blockbench.

**Epic Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All 8 tasks completed, all deliverables validated, ready to begin Epic 03.

**Next Milestone**: Epic 03 completion (weeks 1-2) - First 3 mobs (Fly, Cockroach, Triops) ported, GeckoLib workflow validated, templates created.

---

**Epic 02 Final Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Ready for**: Epic 03 Planning & Execution
**Confidence Level**: HIGH (all deliverables validated, spot-checks passed, roadmap feasible)
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Total Research Time**: ~20-24 hours
**Total Documentation**: 5,600+ lines across 5 documents
