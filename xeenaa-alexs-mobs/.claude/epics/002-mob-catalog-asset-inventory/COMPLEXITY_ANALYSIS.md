## Epic 03 Recommendations (Proof of Concept)

### Recommended 3-5 Mobs for First Port

#### PRIMARY CANDIDATES (Truly Simple - Start Here)

**1. Fly** (SIMPLE - Ultra-Simple)
- **AI Goals**: 4 (wander, flee, bite undead cosmetic, breed)
- **Animations**: 3 (fly idle, fly moving, death)
- **Special Features**: None (breeding is vanilla)
- **Variants**: 1 texture
- **Rationale**: **PERFECT STARTER**. Absolute simplest mob. Passive flying AI is vanilla-like. Bite undead is cosmetic (no damage). Minimal GeckoLib model (small insect). Fastest port possible. Validates flying AI + GeckoLib workflow.

**2. Cockroach** (SIMPLE - Ultra-Simple)
- **AI Goals**: 3 (wander, flee, despawn)
- **Animations**: 3 (walk, idle, death)
- **Special Features**: None
- **Variants**: 1 texture
- **Rationale**: **SIMPLEST LAND MOB**. Tiny pest with minimal AI. Tests basic land pathfinding. Ultra-simple GeckoLib model. No special features. Second-fastest port.

**3. Triops** (SIMPLE - Ultra-Simple)
- **AI Goals**: 3 (swim, idle, death)
- **Animations**: 3 (swim, idle, death)
- **Special Features**: None
- **Variants**: 1 texture
- **Rationale**: **SIMPLEST AQUATIC MOB**. Tiny crustacean. Tests aquatic AI. Simple GeckoLib model. No special features. Completes air/land/water coverage.

---

#### OPTIONAL ADDITIONS (If 5 mobs desired)

**4. Gazelle** (SIMPLE)
- **AI Goals**: 4 (wander, flee, breed, herd)
- **Animations**: 5 (idle, walk, run, graze, death)
- **Special Features**: Basic herd behavior
- **Variants**: 1 texture
- **Rationale**: Tests basic herd AI (follow nearest gazelle). Slightly more complex than insects/fish but still simple. Good quadruped model practice.

**5. Blue Jay** (SIMPLE)
- **AI Goals**: 4 (fly, perch, sing, flee)
- **Animations**: 5 (fly idle, fly moving, perch, sing, death)
- **Special Features**: Singing (sound trigger), shiny variant (rare)
- **Variants**: 2 textures (normal + shiny overlay)
- **Rationale**: Tests flying bird AI with perching. Song mechanic is just sound trigger. Shiny variant tests rare spawn. Good bird model practice.

---

### Why These Mobs for Epic 03?

**Technical Validation**:
- ✅ **Simplest AI** - All use 3-5 basic goals (wander, flee, breed, idle)
- ✅ **Minimal Animations** - 3-5 animations each (no complex rigging)
- ✅ **No Complex Features** - No riding, inventory, transformations, or multi-part
- ✅ **Low Variant Count** - 1-2 textures max (easy testing)
- ✅ **Movement Type Coverage** - Flying (Fly, Blue Jay), Land (Cockroach, Gazelle), Aquatic (Triops)

**Workflow Validation**:
- ✅ Validates GeckoLib model creation (Blockbench)
- ✅ Validates GeckoLib animation system
- ✅ Validates entity registration (Fabric)
- ✅ Validates AI goal implementation
- ✅ Validates texture/sound asset pipeline
- ✅ Validates spawning rules

**User Value**:
- ✅ **Visual Appeal** - All are recognizable, appealing animals (not joke mobs)
- ✅ **Diverse Types** - Shows variety of mod content (not all tiny insects)
- ✅ **Professional** - Sets quality bar for future ports
- ✅ **Fast Delivery** - Can complete 3-5 simple mobs in 1-2 weeks

**Strategic Value**:
- ✅ **Low Risk** - If GeckoLib workflow fails, we find out early with simple mobs
- ✅ **Fast Iteration** - Simple mobs = quick feedback loop
- ✅ **Builds Confidence** - Success validates framework before tackling complex mobs
- ✅ **Reusable Patterns** - Establishes templates for future mobs

---

### AVOID for Epic 03 (Too Complex)

**Borderline "Simple" Mobs to Avoid**:
- ❌ **Sugar Glider** - Tameable + shoulder perch + gliding = medium complexity
- ❌ **Crow** - Item gathering system = medium complexity
- ❌ **Endergrade** - Rideable mechanics = medium complexity
- ❌ **Banana Slug** - Slime trail mechanic = adds complexity
- ❌ **Blobfish** - Transformation mechanic = adds complexity

**Why Avoid**:
- These have ONE special feature that pushes them to medium
- Epic 03 should validate BASIC workflow, not special features
- Save taming/riding/transformations for Epic 04+

---

## Complexity Distribution Summary

### Final Count by Tier

- **Simple**: 30 mobs (33.3%)
- **Medium**: 35 mobs (38.9%)
- **Complex**: 20 mobs (22.2%)
- **Very Complex**: 7 mobs (7.8%)

**Total**: 92 mobs (90 animals + Void Worm + Warped Mosco)

---

### Porting Order Recommendation

**Epic 03** (Proof of Concept): 3-5 Simple mobs (Fly, Cockroach, Triops + optional Gazelle/Blue Jay)
**Epic 04** (Simple Batch): 10-15 Simple mobs (remaining ultra-simple + simple passive)
**Epic 05** (Medium Batch 1): 10-12 Medium mobs (passive/neutral)
**Epic 06** (Medium Batch 2): 10-12 Medium mobs (hostile/defensive)
**Epic 07** (Complex Batch 1): 8-10 Complex mobs (tameable/rideable)
**Epic 08** (Complex Batch 2): 8-10 Complex mobs (advanced AI/equipment)
**Epic 09** (Very Complex): 7 Very Complex mobs (multi-part, bosses)

---

## Analysis Confidence

**High Confidence** (90%+ accurate):
- Simple mob ratings (based on asset counts + basic AI patterns)
- Medium mob ratings (wiki research + asset complexity)
- Very Complex mob ratings (clear multi-part/boss indicators)

**Medium Confidence** (70-90% accurate):
- Complex mob ratings (some may be medium with hidden simplicity)
- Animation counts (estimated based on asset inventory + mob type)
- AI goal counts (inferred from wiki + common patterns)

**Low Confidence** (50-70% accurate):
- Exact animation counts (would need to decompile original mod)
- Exact AI goal counts (would need source code analysis)
- Hidden mechanics not documented on wiki

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **TASK-005 COMPLETE** - Detailed complexity analysis done
2. **User Validation** - Review Epic 03 recommendations
3. **Update CATALOG.md** - Integrate this analysis into main catalog
