## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Small arboreal marsupials
- Climbs trees and glides

### Taming
- **Method**: Feed Sweet Berries
- **Benefits**: Stay/follow/wander, head perching, slow falling

### Special Mechanics
- Head perching: Sneak + interact to place on head
- Grants slow falling while on head
- Foraging: Searches leaf blocks for items
- Usually junk (saplings, sticks) but can find arrows, Hair of Bear, Moose Antlers

### Items & Interactions
- **Eats**: Sweet Berries, Honeycombs
- **Finds**: Saplings, sticks, arrows, Hair of Bear, Moose Antlers

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Stay/follow/wander modes
- **info_1**: Climbs trees
- **info_2**: Glides between trees
- **info_3**: Forages in leaves

### Breeding
- **Item**: Honeycombs
- **Note**: Baby Sugar Gliders cannot glide


## Success Criteria

**Epic is COMPLETE when:**

- [ ] Sugar Glider entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:sugar-glider`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Passive behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Gliding, tameable
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- SugarGliderEntity class
- SugarGliderModel class (GeckoLib model)
- SugarGliderRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (sugar-glider.geo.json)
- Animation file (sugar-glider.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (sugar-glider.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Gliding, tameable

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Simple - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Gliding, tameable
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates

---

## Dependencies

**Required**:
- âœ… Epic 01: GeckoLib framework setup
- âœ… Epic 02: Sugar Glider cataloged in mob inventory
- âœ… Epic 03: Conversion process established
