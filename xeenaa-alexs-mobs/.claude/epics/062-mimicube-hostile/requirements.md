   - Realistic animations and sounds
   - Environment-appropriate spawning

3. **Feature Implementation** - Key mechanics: Mimic mechanics, outer overlay

### Game Mechanics

## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Relatives of slimes/magma cubes
- Guard End Cities
- Powerful magic

### Special Mechanics
- Mimic attack: Copies attacker's weapons and armor
- Can learn: Shield, sword, bow, crossbow, trident, food
- Powerful if attacker uses strong equipment
- Mimicream crafting: 8 mimicream + damageable item = copied tool/equipment with enchantments (zero durability)
- Limitations on copying

### Items & Interactions
- **Drops**: Mimicream
- **Crafted**: Mimicked tools/equipment (zero durability, needs repair)

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Guards End Cities
- **info_1**: Mimics attacker equipment
- **info_2**: Uses weapons/shields learned

### Equipment & Gear
- Mimics any equipment from attacker

### Combat
- **info_0**: Mimics attacker's equipment
- **info_1**: Uses shields, swords, bows, crossbows, tridents
- **info_2**: Difficult if powerful equipment used


## Success Criteria

**Epic is COMPLETE when:**

- [ ] Mimicube entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:mimicube`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Hostile behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Mimic mechanics, outer overlay
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- MimicubeEntity class
- MimicubeModel class (GeckoLib model)
- MimicubeRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (mimicube.geo.json)
- Animation file (mimicube.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (mimicube.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Mimic mechanics, outer overlay

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Medium - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Mimic mechanics, outer overlay
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates

---

## Dependencies

**Required**:
- âœ… Epic 01: GeckoLib framework setup
- âœ… Epic 02: Mimicube cataloged in mob inventory
- âœ… Epic 03: Conversion process established
