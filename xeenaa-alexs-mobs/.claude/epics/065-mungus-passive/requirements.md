## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Strange fungal creatures
- Relatives of Guardian and Strider
- Mycelium coat with mushrooms

### Special Mechanics
- Mushroom feeding: More of same mushroom â†’ more mushrooms grow on Mungus
- Guardian beam: Fires at nearby same-type mushrooms, grows them
- Giant mushroom: Over mycelium, mushroom may become giant
- Exhausts Mungus, lowers mushroom count
- Explosion: Slain with 5 mushrooms â†’ violent explosion + biome conversion
- Biome conversion: Red/Brown â†’ Mushroom Fields, Crimson â†’ Crimson Forest, Warped â†’ Warped Forest
- Poisonous Potato: Undoes biome conversion

### Items & Interactions
- **Eats**: Mushrooms (any type), Mungal Spores (breeding), Poisonous Potato (undo conversion)
- **Drops**: Mungal Spores (every few days)

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Passive
- **info_1**: Fires beams at mushrooms
- **info_2**: Grows mushrooms
- **info_3**: Explodes (5 mushrooms on back)

### Breeding
- **Item**: Mungal Spores


## Success Criteria

**Epic is COMPLETE when:**

- [ ] Mungus entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:mungus`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Passive behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Sack equipment, shoes, special beam
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- MungusEntity class
- MungusModel class (GeckoLib model)
- MungusRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (mungus.geo.json)
- Animation file (mungus.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (mungus.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Sack equipment, shoes, special beam

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Complex - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Sack equipment, shoes, special beam
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates

---

## Dependencies

**Required**:
- âœ… Epic 01: GeckoLib framework setup
- âœ… Epic 02: Mungus cataloged in mob inventory
- âœ… Epic 03: Conversion process established
