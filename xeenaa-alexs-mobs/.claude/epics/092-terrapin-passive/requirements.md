## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Small river turtles
- Completely passive
- Relies on shell for protection

### Special Mechanics
- Can be bucketed
- Jump mechanics: Recedes into shell when jumped on
- Second jump: Spins in direction of jumper, ricochets off walls
- Colliding with mob deals damage (mob may become aggressive)
- Vast array of patterns and colors

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Passive swimming
- **info_1**: Shell mechanics (jump interactions)

### Breeding
- **Item**: Seagrass
- **Produces**: 1-4 eggs
- **Genetics**: Direct cross or mutation to random color
- **info_3**: Colors can be parent's or average of both

### Variants
- Vast array of patterns and colors
- Many unnatural colors
- Mutation mechanic


## Success Criteria

**Epic is COMPLETE when:**

- [ ] Terrapin entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:terrapin`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Passive behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: 6 base colors + 6 shell patterns + 4 skin patterns
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- TerrapinEntity class
- TerrapinModel class (GeckoLib model)
- TerrapinRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (terrapin.geo.json)
- Animation file (terrapin.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (terrapin.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: 6 base colors + 6 shell patterns + 4 skin patterns

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Complex - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: 6 base colors + 6 shell patterns + 4 skin patterns
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates

## Dependencies

**Required**:
- âœ… Epic 01: GeckoLib framework setup
- âœ… Epic 02: Terrapin cataloged in mob inventory
- âœ… Epic 03: Conversion process established
