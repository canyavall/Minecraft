- [ ] Catfish entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:catfish`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Passive behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: 3 size variants (small/medium/large)
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- CatfishEntity class
- CatfishModel class (GeckoLib model)
- CatfishRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (catfish.geo.json)
- Animation file (catfish.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (catfish.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: 3 size variants (small/medium/large)

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop

- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Medium - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: 3 size variants (small/medium/large)
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates
