## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Foul insects
- Avoid light
- Prolific breeders
- Nuisance pest

### Special Mechanics
- Light avoidance: Scatter from torches
- Vulnerable to predators in light
- Ootheca: Egg cases with multiple nymphs
- Bread/Sugar feeding: Makes them comfortable
- Eat dropped food (dangerous in caves)
- Fondness for Maracas
- Beheaded form: Can lose head but function normally
- Prey to Cave Centipedes

### Items & Interactions
- **Eats**: Bread, Sugar (comfort), dropped food
- **Drops**: Ootheca (egg cases), Cockroach Wing Fragments
- **Crafted**: Cockroach Wing (9 fragments), Bug Pheromones Potion (undetected by hostile arthropods)

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Avoids light
- **info_1**: Scatters from torches
- **info_2**: Eats dropped food
- **info_3**: Prolific breeding
- **info_4**: Functions beheaded

### Breeding
- **Item**: Sugar
- **Produces**: Ootheca (egg cases)


## Success Criteria

**Epic is COMPLETE when:**

- [ ] Cockroach entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:cockroach`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Passive behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Small pest, simple AI
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- CockroachEntity class
- CockroachModel class (GeckoLib model)
- CockroachRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (cockroach.geo.json)
- Animation file (cockroach.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (cockroach.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Small pest, simple AI

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Simple - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Small pest, simple AI
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates

---

## Dependencies

**Required**:
- âœ… Epic 01: GeckoLib framework setup
- âœ… Epic 02: Cockroach cataloged in mob inventory
- âœ… Epic 03: Conversion process established
