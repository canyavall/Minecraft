## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Diminutive insects
- Massive colonies (up to 20 ants)
- Two forms: Workers and Queens

### Special Mechanics
- Workers: Harvest leaves, seen outside anthill
- Queen: Stomping anthill summons, much larger/stronger, one per colony
- Repopulation: Queen present + 5 leaves = new worker (max 10 ants)
- Without queen: Cannot repopulate
- Leafcutter Ant Chambers: Underground network, converts leaves to fungi
- Gongylidia farming: Ants farm and eat this fungi
- Chamber sunlight: Converts to dirt
- Chamber spreading: Spreads to adjacent dirt when harvested
- Fungi harvesting: Interact with fungal chamber, requires Shroomlight nearby or ants become hostile
- Feeding: Gongylidia heals, boosts colony (to queen), pacifies area
- Leafcutter Ant Pupa: Rare chamber drop, creates new colony on dirt/grass

### Items & Interactions
- **Harvests**: Leaves
- **Produces**: Gongylidia (fungi)
- **Drops**: Leafcutter Ant Pupa (rare from chambers)
- **Eats**: Gongylidia

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Workers harvest leaves
- **info_1**: Queen commands colony
- **info_2**: Converts leaves to fungi
- **info_3**: Farming behavior
- **info_4**: Hostile without Shroomlight (when harvesting)
- **info_5**: Pacified by feeding

### Breeding
- **Natural**: Queen + 5 leaves = new worker
- **Colony**: Leafcutter Ant Pupa on dirt/grass

### Variants
- Workers
- Queen (larger, stronger)

### Combat
- **info_0**: Queen much stronger
- **info_1**: Colony attacks without Shroomlight

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- LeafcutterAntEntity class
- LeafcutterAntModel class (GeckoLib model)
- LeafcutterAntRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (leafcutter-ant.geo.json)
- Animation file (leafcutter-ant.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (leafcutter-ant.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Queen variant, leaf carrying (3 variants), angry

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Complex - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Queen variant, leaf carrying (3 variants), angry
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates
