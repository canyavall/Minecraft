- Geometry file (caiman.geo.json)
- Animation file (caiman.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (caiman.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Aquatic predator

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
