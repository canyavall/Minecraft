- [ ] Banana Slug entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:banana-slug`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Passive behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: 4 random color variants, slime trail
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

- Geometry file (banana-slug.geo.json)
- Animation file (banana-slug.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (banana-slug.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: 4 random color variants, slime trail

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
