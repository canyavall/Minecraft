## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Noisy birds
- Damage crops (pest)
- Pick up and eat food
- Scared by carved pumpkins

### Taming
- **Method**: Toss Pumpkin Seeds
- **Benefits**: Stay/follow/wander/gather items, shoulder perching, extra damage to undead

### Special Mechanics
- Carved Pumpkin: Scares crows from fields
- Hay block: Tamed crow sitting on it regains health
- Item gathering: Flies around hay block, gathers items
- Container deposit: Matches item to item frame on container, deposits from that side
- Shoulder perching: Sits on owner's shoulders (follow mode), remove by sneaking
- Extra damage to undead

### Items & Interactions
- **Eats**: Pumpkin Seeds (taming), food items

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Stay/wander/follow/gather modes
- **info_1**: Picks up food
- **info_2**: Flies around hay block
- **info_3**: Deposits items in containers (matching item frames)
- **info_4**: Shoulder perching
- **info_5**: Pecks attackers (low damage, doesn't aggro mobs)
- **info_6**: Extra damage to undead

### Combat
- **info_0**: Pecks attackers (low damage)
- **info_1**: Extra damage to undead

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- CrowEntity class
- CrowModel class (GeckoLib model)
- CrowRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (crow.geo.json)
- Animation file (crow.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (crow.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Tameable, item gathering, shoulder perch

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:

- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Medium - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Tameable, item gathering, shoulder perch
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates
