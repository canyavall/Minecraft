## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Curious cephalopod
- Rapid regeneration
- Shape-shifting and color changing

### Taming
- **Method**: Feed 5-8 Lobster Tails (not while camouflaged)
- **Benefits**: Scares attackers, land following, form control, combat mimicry

### Special Mechanics
- Camouflage: Matches any block, almost invisible
- Mimics: Pufferfish, Creepers, Guardians (when nearby)
- Form control: Ink sac toggles random form changes
- Memory system: Prismarine shard = Guardian, Pufferfish drop = Pufferfish, Creeper drop = Creeper
- Slimeball: Prevents drying on land (every few days)
- Mimicream upgrade: 5-8 mimicream = combat abilities (Guardian beams, Pufferfish poison, Creeper explosions)
- Can be bucketed

### Items & Interactions
- **Eats**: Lobster Tails (taming), Tropical Fish (breeding)
- **Uses**: Slimeball (land survival), Ink Sac (toggle forms), Prismarine Shard/Pufferfish/Creeper drops (memory)
- **Upgrade**: Mimicream (combat abilities)

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Sit/wander/follow modes
- **info_1**: Camouflage as blocks
- **info_2**: Mimics nearby creatures
- **info_3**: Scares attackers (tamed)
- **info_4**: Can follow on land (with slimeball)

### Breeding
- **Item**: Tropical Fish

### Variants
- Can mimic: Blocks, Pufferfish, Creepers, Guardians
- Guardian: Beam attacks
- Pufferfish: Poison stabs
- Creeper: Explosions

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- MimicOctopusEntity class
- MimicOctopusModel class (GeckoLib model)
- MimicOctopusRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (mimic-octopus.geo.json)
- Animation file (mimic-octopus.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (mimic-octopus.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Mimicry system (5 forms), overlay effects

### Out of Scope

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Complex - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Mimicry system (5 forms), overlay effects
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates
