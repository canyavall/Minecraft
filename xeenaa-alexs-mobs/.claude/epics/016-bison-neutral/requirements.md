## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Hoofed mammals
- Quick to anger
- Charge at intruders and other bison
- Fling attackers into air

### Special Mechanics
- Shearable: Obtain Bison Fur
- Bison Fur Block: Makes carpets, crafts with boots for powdered snow resistance
- Sheared bison eat grass to regrow coat
- Clear snow layers while moving
- Snow coating in snowy weather: Remove with shovel or place snow layer on them
- Snow melts in water/rain/hot biomes

### Items & Interactions
- **Drops**: Beef, Bison Fur (when sheared)
- **Crafted**: Bison Fur Block, Boots upgrade

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Aggressive when approached
- **info_1**: Charge attacks
- **info_2**: Young are defenseless
- **info_3**: Adult bison clear snow
- **info_4**: Eat grass (to regrow fur)

### Breeding
- **Item**: Wheat

### Combat
- **info_0**: Charge attack
- **info_1**: Fling into air

**Epic is COMPLETE when:**

- [ ] Bison entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:bison`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Neutral behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Rideable, shearable, baby variants
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- BisonEntity class
- BisonModel class (GeckoLib model)
- BisonRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (bison.geo.json)
- Animation file (bison.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (bison.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Rideable, shearable, baby variants

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Complex - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Rideable, shearable, baby variants
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates

---

## Dependencies

**Required**:
- âœ… Epic 01: GeckoLib framework setup
- âœ… Epic 02: Bison cataloged in mob inventory
- âœ… Epic 03: Conversion process established
