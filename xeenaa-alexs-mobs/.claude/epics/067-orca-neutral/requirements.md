## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- OrcaEntity class
- OrcaModel class (GeckoLib model)
- OrcaRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (orca.geo.json)
- Animation file (orca.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (orca.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: 4 directional variants (NE/NW/SE/SW)

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
