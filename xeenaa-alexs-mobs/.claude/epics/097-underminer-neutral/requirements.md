## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Rare ghostly inhabitants
- Ethereal (walk through walls)
- Only damaged by magic

### Special Mechanics
- Appears after time spent in mineshaft
- Disappears if approached
- Mines blocks with ghostly pickaxe (cannot destroy, reveals hidden ores)
- Ore-specific mining: Drop ore block near Underminer, becomes visible and seeks/mines that ore
- Mistrust of newcomers
- Stalks halls for hundreds of years

### Items & Interactions
- **Drops**: Ghostly Pickaxe (when slain with magic)
- **Ghostly Pickaxe**: Stores 9 stacks when inventory full, returns items when space available, repairs with phantom membranes

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Stalks mineshafts
- **info_1**: Mines blocks (reveals ores)
- **info_2**: Disappears when approached
- **info_3**: Seeks specific ore when given

### Equipment & Gear
- Ghostly Pickaxe

### Combat
- **info_0**: No threat (passive unless attacked)
- **info_1**: Only damaged by magic
