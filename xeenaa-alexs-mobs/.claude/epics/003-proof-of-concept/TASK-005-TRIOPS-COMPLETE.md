# TASK-005: Triops Conversion - COMPLETE ✅

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Animal**: Triops
**Date Completed**: 2025-10-27

## Summary

Successfully converted the Triops entity from Citadel/Forge to GeckoLib/Fabric with full animation support, proper positioning, and correct behavior.

## Implementation Details

### Model Specifications
- **Bones**: 10 total
  - root (Y=24 pivot)
  - body (7×3×7 cube, parent: root)
  - leftAntenna, rightAntenna (4×1×3 cubes)
  - leftLegs, rightLegs (3×0×4 flat cubes with ±5° default rotation)
  - tail1 (3 cubes: main body + 2 side appendages)
  - tail2 (3×2×4 cube, parent: tail1)
  - leftTailFlipper, rightTailFlipper (1×0×6 thin flippers with 15° default angles)
- **Texture**: 64×64 pixels
- **Hierarchy**: Proper parent-child relationships for articulated movement

### Animations
1. **Idle** (4.0s loop) - Used on land
   - Antennae: ±5° Y-axis sway (opposite directions)
   - Legs: Flutter between 5° and 10° at 3× speed
   - Tail1: ±3° gentle sway
   - Tail2: ±5° sway
   - Tail flippers: Subtle movement around 15° default angles

2. **Swim** (1.54s loop) - Used in water
   - Body: ±3° X-axis, ±5° Z-axis undulation
   - Antennae: ±8° stronger sway
   - Legs: Rapid rowing motion (5° to 15°)
   - Tail1: ±8° whipping motion
   - Tail2: ±12° stronger whipping
   - Tail flippers: Wide sweeping (5° to 25°)

### Rendering Adjustments
- **Y-offset**: -1.3 (corrects Citadel Y=24 → Minecraft Y=0)
- **Scale**: 1.0 (original size, no scaling needed)
- **Shadow radius**: 0.2f

### Entity Behavior
- **Base class**: FishEntity (provides aquatic behavior and flopping on land)
- **Health**: 3 HP
- **Movement speed**: 0.4
- **AI Goals**:
  - EscapeDangerGoal (1.25 speed multiplier)
  - FleeEntityGoal (flees from players at 8 blocks, speeds 1.6/1.4)
  - SwimAroundGoal (wanders in water)
- **Sounds**: Uses ENTITY_TROPICAL_FISH_FLOP on land
- **Bucketing**: Not supported (returns water bucket)

## Key Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Animations Not Playing
**Problem**: Animations were not visible in-game despite model loading correctly.

**Root Cause**: Animation names in entity code ("swim", "idle") didn't match the full names in the JSON file ("animation.triops_citadel.swim", "animation.triops_citadel.idle").

**Solution**: Updated TriopsEntity.java animation references to use full animation names:
```java
// Before (broken)
state.getController().setAnimation(RawAnimation.begin().then("swim", Animation.LoopType.LOOP));

// After (working)
state.getController().setAnimation(RawAnimation.begin().then("animation.triops_citadel.swim", Animation.LoopType.LOOP));
```

**Files Modified**: `TriopsEntity.java:62,64`

### Issue 2: Ground Clipping
**Problem**: Triops spawned partially inside terrain blocks.

**Root Cause**: Initial Y-offset of -1.5 was too low for the Triops model structure.

**Solution**: Adjusted Y-offset to -1.3 in TriopsRenderer.java, eliminating clipping while maintaining proper ground contact.

**Files Modified**: `TriopsRenderer.java:32`

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/main/resources/assets/xeenaa-alexs-mobs/geo/triops_citadel.geo.json` - GeckoLib geometry
- `src/main/resources/assets/xeenaa-alexs-mobs/animations/triops_citadel.animation.json` - GeckoLib animations
- `.claude/epics/03-proof-of-concept/decompiled/com/github/alexthe666/alexsmobs/client/model/ModelTriops.java` - Decompiled source

### Modified
- `src/main/java/com/canya/xeenaa_alexs_mobs/entity/animal/TriopsEntity.java` - Fixed animation names
- `src/main/java/com/canya/xeenaa_alexs_mobs/client/renderer/TriopsRenderer.java` - Added Y-offset override

### Existing (Pre-configured)
- `src/main/java/com/canya/xeenaa_alexs_mobs/client/model/TriopsModel.java` - Already pointing to correct files
- Registration already complete in ModEntities and AlexsMobsClient

## Validation Checklist

All items verified in-game:

### Visual/Model ✅
- [x] Model appears correctly (body, antennae, legs, tail segments, flippers)
- [x] Texture shows properly (brownish carapace with segmented body)
- [x] Size looks appropriate (small aquatic crustacean)
- [x] Positioning is correct (no ground clipping)

### Animations ✅
- [x] **Idle animation** (on land): Antennae sway, legs flutter, tail sways
- [x] **Swim animation** (in water): Body undulates, legs row, tail whips, flippers sweep

### Behavior ✅
- [x] Swims around in water (SwimAroundGoal working)
- [x] Flops/jumps when on land (FishEntity behavior - correct)
- [x] Flees from players when nearby (FleeEntityGoal at 8 blocks)
- [x] Escapes from danger (EscapeDangerGoal working)

### Technical ✅
- [x] Health: 3 HP (dies in 2 hits)
- [x] Makes fish flop sound on land
- [x] Cannot be bucketed (returns water bucket)

## Lessons Learned

### Animation Naming Convention
**Discovery**: GeckoLib requires EXACT animation name matches between JSON and entity code. The full animation name format is `"animation.{model_name}.{animation_name}"`.

**Pattern Established**:
- JSON key: `"animation.triops_citadel.swim"`
- Java reference: `RawAnimation.begin().then("animation.triops_citadel.swim", ...)`

This pattern must be followed for ALL future conversions.

### Y-Offset Varies by Model
**Observation**: Each model requires different Y-offset adjustments:
- Fly: 0.5 (positive, moves UP)
- Cockroach: -1.3
- Triops: -1.3

**Conclusion**: Y-offset depends on model pivot structure and bone hierarchy. Must be fine-tuned per animal through in-game testing.

### FishEntity Behavior
**Note**: Using FishEntity as base class automatically provides:
- Flopping behavior on land (realistic for aquatic creatures)
- Water breathing requirement
- Swimming AI compatibility
- Bucket interaction system (even if disabled)

This is the correct choice for small aquatic animals like Triops.

## Performance Notes

- Model complexity: Low (10 bones, simple geometry)
- Animation complexity: Moderate (2 animations with smooth keyframes)
- Expected performance: Excellent (suitable for swarms/groups)
- No custom rendering layers needed (standard entity rendering)

## Next Steps

The Triops conversion is **100% complete** and serves as the third successful proof-of-concept for the Citadel→GeckoLib conversion process.

**Conversion Process Validated** ✅
1. Decompile Citadel model
2. Extract bone hierarchy and geometry
3. Convert to GeckoLib JSON format
4. Create animation JSON with full naming convention
5. Configure entity with proper animation references
6. Add renderer with Y-offset adjustment
7. Test and fine-tune positioning

**Ready for**: Next animal conversion or Epic 03 completion assessment.
