## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Giant herbivorous mammals
- Massive antlers
- Protective parents

### Special Mechanics
- Antler drop: Every 7-10 days (chance)
- Antler headdress: 2 antlers = knockback abilities
- Regrow antlers: 3-5 days
- Jostle for dominance (antler to antler)
- Defend young from predators (wolves)
- Snow coating: Remove with shovel or place snow layer

### Items & Interactions
- **Drops**: Moose Antlers (periodic), Moose Ribs
- **Crafted**: Antler Headdress (knockback abilities)

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Jostling (dominance)
- **info_1**: Defends young
- **info_2**: Antler drop cycle
- **info_3**: Antler regrowth

### Breeding
- **Item**: Multiple Dandelions

### Combat
- **info_0**: Massive antler attacks
- **info_1**: Dangerous damage
- **info_2**: Protects offspring

- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Neutral behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Rideable, antlered variants, snowy variants
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- MooseEntity class
- MooseModel class (GeckoLib model)
- MooseRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (moose.geo.json)
- Animation file (moose.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (moose.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Rideable, antlered variants, snowy variants

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity

- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Complex - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Rideable, antlered variants, snowy variants
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates
