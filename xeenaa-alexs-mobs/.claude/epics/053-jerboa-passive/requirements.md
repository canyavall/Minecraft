   - Realistic animations and sounds
   - Environment-appropriate spawning

3. **Feature Implementation** - Key mechanics: Small rodent, sleeping state

### Game Mechanics

**Entity Type**: Passive Animal
**Size**: TBD (check original model)
**Behavior**: passive
**Health**: TBD
**Drops**: TBD
**Spawning**: Desert

## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Small nocturnal mammals
- Very long back legs
- Sleeps during day, bounces at night
- Prey to rattlesnakes, foxes, cats

### Special Mechanics

- Fed Jerboa won't despawn

### Items & Interactions
- **Eats**: Seeds, Maggots
- **Drops**: None specified

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Sleeps during day
- **info_1**: Bounces at night
- **info_2**: Begs for seeds
- **info_3**: Shy/flees from predators

### Breeding
- **Item**: Maggots or small insects


## Success Criteria

**Epic is COMPLETE when:**

- [ ] Jerboa entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:jerboa`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Passive behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Small rodent, sleeping state
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- JerboaEntity class
- JerboaModel class (GeckoLib model)
- JerboaRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (jerboa.geo.json)
- Animation file (jerboa.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (jerboa.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Small rodent, sleeping state

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Simple - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Small rodent, sleeping state
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates

---

## Dependencies

**Required**:
- âœ… Epic 01: GeckoLib framework setup
- âœ… Epic 02: Jerboa cataloged in mob inventory
- âœ… Epic 03: Conversion process established

---

## Deliverables

### Code Files

## Timeline

**Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 days

---

## Validation & Testing

**Manual Testing Required**:
- [ ] Spawns correctly via `/summon`
- [ ] Spawns naturally in biomes
- [ ] Model renders properly
- [ ] All animations play correctly
- [ ] AI behaves according to Passive type
- [ ] Special features work: Small rodent, sleeping state
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] Size and scale correct
- [ ] Performance acceptable
