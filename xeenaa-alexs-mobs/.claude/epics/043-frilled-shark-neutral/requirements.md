## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Lethargic living fossils
- Hunt blobfish and squid
- Reflective teeth (lure prey)

### Special Mechanics
- Luring: Uses reflective teeth in low-light to lure squid
- Exsanguination effect: Serrated teeth quickly drain health
- Teeth shedding: Occasional when attacking squid
- Can be bucketed
- Depressurized: Discolored and slower under 10 blocks water

### Items & Interactions
- **Drops**: Serrated Shark Teeth (shed)
- **Crafted**: Shield of the Deep (more durable, inflicts Exsanguination when blocking)

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Lethargic hunting
- **info_1**: Lures prey with teeth
- **info_2**: Exsanguination attacks

### Variants
- Normal (deep)
- Depressurized (pale, slow, shallow)

### Combat
- **info_0**: Serrated teeth
- **info_1**: Exsanguination effect

- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Neutral behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Depressurized variant, kaiju variant
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior
