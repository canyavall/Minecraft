## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Strange canine (neither wolf nor fox)
- Primarily frugivorous
- Known as "Skunk Wolf"

### Special Mechanics
- Apple feeding: Makes wolf shake fur and release smell
- Smell attracts other animals (herding livestock)
- Smell increases fungus production in Leafcutter anthills

### Items & Interactions
- **Eats**: Apples

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Passive movement
- **info_1**: Shakes when fed apples
- **info_2**: Emits attraction smell

### Breeding
- **Item**: Rabbit or Chicken meat


## Success Criteria

**Epic is COMPLETE when:**

- [ ] Maned Wolf entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:maned-wolf`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Passive behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Ender variant
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- ManedWolfEntity class
- ManedWolfModel class (GeckoLib model)
- ManedWolfRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (maned-wolf.geo.json)
- Animation file (maned-wolf.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (maned-wolf.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Ender variant

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Simple - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Ender variant
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates

## Dependencies

**Required**:
- âœ… Epic 01: GeckoLib framework setup
- âœ… Epic 02: Maned Wolf cataloged in mob inventory
- âœ… Epic 03: Conversion process established
