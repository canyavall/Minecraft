## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Mostly aquatic mammals
- Bask and sleep on sand/ice
- Extremely adept swimmers
- Prey to Orcas

### Special Mechanics
- Primitive trade: Feed 3 fish to basking seal on land
- Seal scrounge seabed for item to return
- Usually junk (kelp, sand) but can be rare (shark teeth, scutes, nautilus shells)
- Entire pod flees if one attacked (swim to water)

### Items & Interactions
- **Eats**: Fish (3 for trade)
- **Returns**: Kelp, sand, shark teeth, scutes, nautilus shells

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Basks on land
- **info_1**: Fast swimmer
- **info_2**: Flees to water when attacked
- **info_3**: Pod behavior

### Breeding
- **Item**: Lobster Tails


## Success Criteria

**Epic is COMPLETE when:**

- [ ] Seal entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:seal`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Passive behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: 2 arctic variants, 2 brown variants, baby/crying
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- SealEntity class
- SealModel class (GeckoLib model)
- SealRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (seal.geo.json)
- Animation file (seal.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (seal.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: 2 arctic variants, 2 brown variants, baby/crying

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Medium - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: 2 arctic variants, 2 brown variants, baby/crying
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates

---

## Dependencies

**Required**:
- âœ… Epic 01: GeckoLib framework setup
- âœ… Epic 02: Seal cataloged in mob inventory
- âœ… Epic 03: Conversion process established
