- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Passive behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Tiny pest, minimal AI
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- FlyEntity class
- FlyModel class (GeckoLib model)
- FlyRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (fly.geo.json)
- Animation file (fly.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (fly.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Tiny pest, minimal AI

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Simple - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Tiny pest, minimal AI
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates

## Dependencies

**Required**:
- âœ… Epic 01: GeckoLib framework setup
- âœ… Epic 02: Fly cataloged in mob inventory
- âœ… Epic 03: Conversion process established
