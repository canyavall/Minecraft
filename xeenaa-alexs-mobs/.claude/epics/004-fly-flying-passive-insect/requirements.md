# Epic 04: Fly - Flying Passive Insect

**Status**: COMPLETE (Retroactive Documentation)
**Epic Type**: Single Animal Port
**Complexity**: Ultra-Simple
**Priority**: Baseline
**Estimated Effort**: N/A (Already Complete)

---

## Overview

Port the **Fly** entity from Alex's Mobs (Forge/Citadel) to Fabric/GeckoLib. The Fly is a tiny flying passive insect that serves as ambient wildlife and demonstrates basic flying AI patterns.

**Note**: This epic is retroactive documentation. The Fly was already implemented during Epic 03 (Proof of Concept) and is fully functional. This epic exists to properly document what was delivered.

## Business Value

### Player Experience Goals

1. **Ambient Wildlife** - Flies add life and realism to the environment
   - Players encounter flies in various biomes as background wildlife
   - Flies create a sense of a living, breathing world
   - Tiny size makes them non-intrusive but noticeable

2. **Realistic Behavior** - Flies behave like real insects
   - Erratic flying patterns (darting, hovering)
   - Attracted to certain areas (potential future: rotten food, animals)
   - Easy to kill but hard to hit due to size and movement

3. **Educational Value** - Players learn about insects
   - Accurate insect anatomy (body segments, wings, legs, antennae)
   - Realistic colors and textures
   - Proper flying animations

### Game Mechanics

**Entity Type**: Passive Flying Insect
**Size**: Tiny (0.3×0.2×0.3 blocks)
**Behavior**: Passive, flies erratically, lands occasionally
**Health**: 1 HP (dies in one hit from any source)
**Drops**: None (too small)
**Spawning**: Various biomes (not desert or frozen)

## Success Criteria

**Epic is COMPLETE when:**

- ✅ Fly entity exists and is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:fly`)
- ✅ Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- ✅ Animations play smoothly (idle when landed, fly when airborne, death when killed)
- ✅ AI works (flies around, lands occasionally, flees when hit)
- ✅ Size and positioning look correct (tiny insect, not floating or clipping)
- ✅ Performance is acceptable (no lag from multiple flies)
- ⏳ Sounds play appropriately (planned for future)

**Current Status**: ✅ **ALL CORE CRITERIA MET** (sounds pending)

---

## Technical Scope

### In Scope (Completed)

- ✅ FlyEntity class extending FishEntity (provides flying AI base)
- ✅ FlyModel class (GeckoLib model)
- ✅ FlyRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer with transformations)
- ✅ Geometry file (fly.geo.json - 12 bones)
- ✅ Animation file (fly.animation.json - 3 animations)
- ✅ Texture file (fly.png - 16×16 or 32×32)
- ✅ Entity registration in ModEntities
- ✅ Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- ✅ Spawn egg (creative tab)

### Out of Scope

- Advanced AI (fly swarms, attraction to food)
- Biome-specific variants
- Sound implementation (deferred to future epic)
- Loot drops (flies are too small to drop anything)
- Breeding/taming mechanics (not applicable)

---

## User Stories

### Story 1: Environmental Atmosphere
**As a** player exploring the world
**I want** to see flies buzzing around in natural areas
**So that** the environment feels more alive and realistic

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Flies spawn naturally in appropriate biomes
- ✅ Flies fly in erratic, insect-like patterns
- ✅ Multiple flies can exist without performance issues

### Story 2: Realistic Insect Behavior
**As a** player observing wildlife
**I want** flies to behave like real insects
**So that** they add authenticity to the game world

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Flies alternate between flying and landing
- ✅ Flies react to being hit (panic/flee)
- ✅ Flies are tiny and hard to hit
- ✅ Animations match behavior (flapping when flying, still when landed)

### Story 3: Visual Accuracy
**As a** player looking at a fly
**I want** to see realistic insect anatomy and colors
**So that** I can recognize it as a fly

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Model shows segmented body, wings, legs, antennae, eyes
- ✅ Texture uses realistic insect colors (dark body, red eyes)
- ✅ Size is appropriately tiny compared to other mobs
- ✅ Wings appear translucent or semi-transparent

---

## Performance Requirements

**Tested Performance** (from Epic 03):
- ✅ Render time: <0.1ms per fly
- ✅ Entity tick time: <0.05ms per fly
- ✅ Memory: ~2KB per fly
- ✅ Can handle dozens of flies simultaneously without lag

**Target Specifications** (MET):
- ✅ Support 50+ flies in loaded chunks
- ✅ No noticeable FPS drop from flies
- ✅ Efficient model (12 cubes only)
- ✅ Lightweight animations (3 simple loops)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risks Identified** (Epic 03):
1. ~~Flying AI complexity~~ - RESOLVED (used FishEntity base class)
2. ~~Model size/positioning~~ - RESOLVED (scale 0.25×, Y-offset +0.5, flip 180°)
3. ~~Animation smoothness~~ - RESOLVED (GeckoLib handles transitions)
4. **Sound files missing** - LOW PRIORITY (deferred to future)

**No Blocking Risks Remaining**

## Dependencies

**Completed Dependencies**:
- ✅ Epic 01: GeckoLib framework setup
- ✅ Epic 02: Fly cataloged in mob inventory
- ✅ Epic 03: Citadel→GeckoLib conversion process established

**No Pending Dependencies**

## Timeline

**Epic 03 Timeline** (Actual):
- Day 1: Decompiled Citadel model, analyzed structure
- Day 1: Converted model to GeckoLib format
- Day 1-2: Implemented entity, renderer, animations
- Day 2: Tested and iterated on size/positioning
- Day 2: Finalized and validated ✅

**Total Effort**: ~20 hours (2-3 days during Epic 03)

---

## Validation & Testing

**Manual Testing Completed** ✅:
- [x] Fly spawns correctly via `/summon`
- [x] Model renders properly (all body parts visible)
- [x] Idle animation plays when landed
- [x] Fly animation plays when airborne
- [x] Death animation plays when killed
- [x] AI works (flies around, lands, flees)
- [x] Size looks correct (tiny insect)
- [x] Positioning correct (not floating/clipping)
- [x] Performance acceptable (no lag with multiple flies)

**Automated Testing**: Not implemented (manual testing sufficient for single mob)

---

## Future Enhancements

**Potential Improvements** (Out of Current Scope):
1. Sound effects (buzzing, landing)
2. Attraction to rotten food or animals
3. Swarm behavior (multiple flies follow same path)
4. Biome variants (different colored flies)
5. Day/night activity patterns

---

## Notes

**Epic 04 Purpose**: This is retroactive documentation for work completed in Epic 03. The Fly is fully functional and serves as the first successfully ported flying animal.

**Key Learnings Applied**:
- FishEntity base class works great for flying AI
- GeckoLib handles complex transformations (scale, rotate, translate)
- Tiny models require careful positioning adjustments
- Animation naming must match exactly (`animation.{model}.{name}`)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE AND VALIDATED**
