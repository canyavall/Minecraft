# Epic 04: Fly - Flying Passive Insect - Implementation Plan

**Status**: COMPLETE (Retroactive)
**Epic Type**: Single Animal Port
**Total Tasks**: N/A (Already completed during Epic 03)

---

## Retroactive Note

This epic is retroactive documentation for the Fly entity, which was successfully implemented during Epic 03 (Proof of Concept). The Fly is fully functional and validated.

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-26 (during Epic 03)
**Actual Effort**: ~20 hours over 2-3 days

---

## What Was Delivered

### Code Implementation ✅
- `FlyEntity.java` - Entity with flying AI and GeckoLib animations
- `FlyModel.java` - GeckoLib model definition
- `FlyRenderer.java` - Custom renderer with scale/rotate/translate transformations

### Resource Files ✅
- `fly.geo.json` - Model geometry (12 bones: body, head, wings, legs, antennae)
- `fly.animation.json` - Animations (idle, fly, death)
- `fly.png` - Texture with dark body, red eyes, translucent wings

### Documentation ✅
- COMPARISON_FLY_CONVERSION.md - Detailed conversion analysis
- TASK-004-COMPARISON-TEST.md - Completion validation

---

## Key Achievements

1. **First Flying Animal** - Validated that FishEntity base class works for flying AI
2. **Complex Transformations** - Proved GeckoLib can handle scale (0.25×), rotation (180°), and translation (+0.5)
3. **Animation System** - Established full animation naming pattern (`animation.{model}.{name}`)
4. **Conversion Process** - Created reusable workflow for Citadel→GeckoLib conversion

## Technical Highlights

**Rendering Adjustments**:
- Scale: 0.25× (reduced from original size)
- Y-offset: +0.5 (prevents underground spawning)
- Rotation: 180° Z-axis (flips upside-down for correct orientation)
- Shadow: 0.1f radius (tiny shadow for tiny mob)

**AI Configuration**:
- Base class: FishEntity (provides flying behavior)
- WanderAroundGoal - Flies in random directions
- LandOnBlockGoal - Occasionally rests on blocks
- PanicGoal - Flees when hit
- LookAroundGoal - Observes surroundings

**Animation Controller**:
- Idle: When on ground (isOnGround())
- Fly: When airborne (!isOnGround())
- Death: When entity dies (isDead())

## Validation Results

**All Success Criteria Met** ✅:
- [x] Entity summonable via `/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:fly`
- [x] Model renders correctly with all parts visible
- [x] Animations play smoothly and transition properly
- [x] AI works as expected (flies, lands, flees)
- [x] Size and positioning look correct
- [x] Performance excellent (can handle dozens of flies)

---

**Epic Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

No further implementation needed. This epic serves as documentation for completed work.
