## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Ancient creature
- Interdimensional parasite
- Boss fight
- Tunnel through reality

### Special Mechanics
- Summoning: Toss Mysterious Worm into End's void
- Mysterious Worm: Place Crimson Mosquito Larva in Enderiophage Capsid
- Splitting: Damaged body segment stops glowing, destroyed = splits in two (half health, slower)
- Can spawn many worms if not careful
- Dimensional Carver: Eye + mandibles + netherite = portal to spawn (20 uses)
- Shattered Dimensional Carver: Dimensional Carver in Capsid = portal 1 million blocks

### Items & Interactions
- **Drops**: Void Worm Eye, Void Worm Mandibles (x2)
- **Crafted**: Void Worm Beak (trophy, bites with redstone), Dimensional Carver (spawn portal, 20 uses), Shattered Dimensional Carver

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Dwells in void
- **info_1**: Tunnels through reality
- **info_2**: Splits when damaged

### Combat
- **info_0**: Homing crystals (up to 4)
- **info_1**: Direct bite attacks
- **info_2**: Portal tearing (reach hidden prey)
- **info_3**: Splitting (when segments destroyed)
- **info_4**: Head damage only (body segments split worm)


## Success Criteria

**Epic is COMPLETE when:**

- [ ] Void Worm entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:void-worm`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Boss behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Boss mob, multi-part, portal mechanics
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- VoidWormEntity class
- VoidWormModel class (GeckoLib model)
- VoidWormRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (void-worm.geo.json)
- Animation file (void-worm.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (void-worm.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Boss mob, multi-part, portal mechanics

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Very Complex - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Boss mob, multi-part, portal mechanics
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates
