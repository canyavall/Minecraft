- [ ] Potoo entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:potoo`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Passive behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Camouflage bird
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- PotooEntity class
- PotooModel class (GeckoLib model)
- PotooRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (potoo.geo.json)
- Animation file (potoo.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (potoo.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Camouflage bird

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Simple - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Camouflage bird
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates
