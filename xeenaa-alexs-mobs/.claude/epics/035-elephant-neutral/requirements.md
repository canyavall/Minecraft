## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Giant land mammals
- Three types: Calves, Tusked, Non-tusked

### Special Mechanics
- Rideable by interaction
- Chest: Adds large inventory to back (access by sneaking)
- Carpet decoration: Any carpet, remove with shears
- Charge attack: Feed wheat while riding (tusked only), requires rest period
- Tear leaves for Acacia Blossoms (rare drop)
- Wandering Traders: Can spawn on trader elephants with chest loot

### Items & Interactions
- **Eats**: Acacia Blossoms (taming, breeding)
- **Drops**: Acacia Blossoms (from trees, rare)

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Herd behavior
- **info_1**: Defensive of herd
- **info_2**: Trunk toss attacks
- **info_3**: Rear up and stomp
- **info_4**: Tear leaves from trees
- **info_5**: Charge attack (tusked)

### Equipment & Gear
