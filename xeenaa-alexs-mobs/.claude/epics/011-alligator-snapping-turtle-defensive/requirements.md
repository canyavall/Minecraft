## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- AlligatorSnappingTurtleEntity class
- AlligatorSnappingTurtleModel class (GeckoLib model)
- AlligatorSnappingTurtleRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (alligator-snapping-turtle.geo.json)
- Animation file (alligator-snapping-turtle.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (alligator-snapping-turtle.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Aquatic, bite attack when provoked

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Medium - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Aquatic, bite attack when provoked
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates
