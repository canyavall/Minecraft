## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Unique mammal (combination of animals)
- Poisonous spines on feet
- Electric sensitivity (weak smell/hearing/sight)

### Special Mechanics
- Redstone attraction: Naturally attracted when held
- Redstone feeding: Recharges electric sensitivity, digs up items from clay
- Redstone block feeding: Greatly increases items dug up
- Digs up: Clay balls, maggots
- Can be bucketed

### Items & Interactions
- **Eats**: Redstone (charging), Redstone Block (supercharge), Lobster Tails (breeding)
- **Finds**: Clay balls, maggots

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Attracted to redstone
- **info_1**: Digs in clay blocks
- **info_2**: Hunts with electricity

### Breeding
- **Item**: Lobster Tails

### Combat
- **info_0**: Poisonous spines (defense)
- **info_1**: Inflicts poison on attackers


## Success Criteria

**Epic is COMPLETE when:**

- [ ] Platypus entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:platypus`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Defensive behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Aquatic, fedora/perry variants
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- PlatypusEntity class
- PlatypusModel class (GeckoLib model)
- PlatypusRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (platypus.geo.json)
- Animation file (platypus.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (platypus.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Aquatic, fedora/perry variants

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Simple - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Aquatic, fedora/perry variants
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates
