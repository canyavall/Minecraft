## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- SnowLeopardEntity class
- SnowLeopardModel class (GeckoLib model)
- SnowLeopardRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (snow-leopard.geo.json)
- Animation file (snow-leopard.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (snow-leopard.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Stealth predator, sleeping state

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
