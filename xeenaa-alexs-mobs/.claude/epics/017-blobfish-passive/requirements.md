   - Players encounter blobfish in deep ocean
   - Enriches biodiversity and exploration rewards
   - Creates memorable encounters

2. **Authentic Behavior** - Behaves according to its category (passive)
   - Passive-appropriate AI and interactions
   - Realistic animations and sounds
   - Environment-appropriate spawning

3. **Feature Implementation** - Key mechanics: Pressure variants (depressurized)

### Game Mechanics

## Features & Functionality

### Core Features
- Gelatinous fish
- Grey and compressed naturally
- Pink pile of sludge in low pressure

### Special Mechanics
- Pressure-dependent: Pink sludge under 10 blocks of water
- Fish Oil crafting: 4 blobfish + bottle = Fish Oil
- Fish Oil effect: Limited levitation in water or rain
- Can be bucketed
- Slimeball application: Allows land survival (display purposes)

### Items & Interactions
- **Drops**: Blobfish (itself)
- **Crafted**: Fish Oil (4 blobfish + bottle)
- **Uses**: Slimeball (land survival)

### AI Behaviors
- **info_0**: Passive swimming
- **info_1**: Pressure-based appearance change

### Variants
- Grey compressed (deep water)
- Pink sludge (shallow water)


## Success Criteria

**Epic is COMPLETE when:**

- [ ] Blobfish entity is summonable (`/summon xeenaa-alexs-mobs:blobfish`)
- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Passive behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Pressure variants (depressurized)
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- BlobfishEntity class
- BlobfishModel class (GeckoLib model)
- BlobfishRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (blobfish.geo.json)
- Animation file (blobfish.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (blobfish.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Pressure variants (depressurized)

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)
- Multiple biome variants (unless specified)

---

## Performance Requirements

**Target Specifications**:
- Support multiple entities in loaded chunks
- No noticeable FPS drop
- Render time: <0.2ms per entity
- Entity tick time: <0.15ms per entity
- Memory: <5KB per entity

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Simple - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Pressure variants (depressurized)
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates

---

## Dependencies

**Required**:
- âœ… Epic 01: GeckoLib framework setup
- âœ… Epic 02: Blobfish cataloged in mob inventory
- âœ… Epic 03: Conversion process established

---
