- [ ] Model appears correctly with all body parts visible
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] AI works according to Passive behavior
- [ ] Spawns naturally in appropriate biomes
- [ ] Size and positioning look correct
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Sounds play appropriately
- [ ] All special features implemented: Flying scavenger, wingull variant
- [ ] User validates in-game appearance and behavior

## Technical Scope

### In Scope

- SeagullEntity class
- SeagullModel class (GeckoLib model)
- SeagullRenderer class (GeckoLib renderer)
- Geometry file (seagull.geo.json)
- Animation file (seagull.animation.json)
- Texture file(s) (seagull.png + variants)
- Entity registration in ModEntities
- Renderer registration in AlexsMobsClient
- Spawn egg (creative tab)
- Sound effects
- Special features: Flying scavenger, wingull variant

### Out of Scope

- Advanced breeding mechanics (unless required)
- Complex equipment systems (unless in features)

## Risks & Mitigations

**Potential Risks**:
1. **Complexity**: Simple - May require significant development time
   - Mitigation: Break into subtasks, reference similar mobs
2. **Special Features**: Flying scavenger, wingull variant
   - Mitigation: Research original implementation, study vanilla equivalents
3. **Performance**: Complex entities may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize, limit spawn rates
