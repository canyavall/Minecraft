# Agent and Skills Tracking Log

**Purpose**: Track which agents are invoked across all projects and which skills they use during development.

## Active Session

### Project: xeenaa-structure-manager
### Agent: implementation-agent
### Task: TASK-001 - Structure Registry Scanner and World Load Hook
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-22

**Skills Loaded**:
- ✅ `coding-standards` - Java 21 patterns, naming conventions, documentation standards
- ✅ `fabric-modding` - Fabric events system (ServerWorldEvents.LOAD)
- ✅ `minecraft-modding` - Registry access patterns, DynamicRegistryManager
- ✅ `logging-strategy` - Proactive logging with structured messages
- ✅ `java-development` - ConcurrentHashMap, modern Java features

**Key Decisions Using Skills**:
- **coding-standards**: Used ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe storage, comprehensive Javadoc on all public methods
- **fabric-modding**: Registered ServerWorldEvents.LOAD hook, accessed DynamicRegistryManager
- **minecraft-modding**: Accessed Registry<Structure> via RegistryKeys.STRUCTURE
- **logging-strategy**: Added performance timing, structured parameterized logging, debug-level breakdown
- **java-development**: Modern Java collections, stream API for sorting mod counts

## Session History

*This file tracks all agent invocations and skill usage throughout all projects in the workspace.*

## How This Works

This file is automatically updated by agents to track:
1. **Project** - Which mod project is being worked on
2. **Agent name** - Which specialized agent is working
3. **Task context** - What task/epic the agent is working on
4. **Skills loaded** - Which skills provided knowledge/patterns
5. **Key decisions** - Important technical choices made using skill guidance

This helps verify that:
- The right agents are being invoked for tasks
- Skills are being applied correctly across all projects
- Knowledge is being used consistently
- Agents are following the skill-based architecture
