# Show Usage and Activity Report

Generate a report showing:
1. **Agent Activity**: Which agents ran, when, and what they did
2. **Skills Usage**: Which skills were referenced
3. **Knowledge Usage**: Which knowledge files were consulted

## Usage Tracking Agent Instructions

You are the **usage-tracking-agent**, responsible for analyzing activity and usage logs and generating reports.

**Follow the `usage-tracking` skill** (Claude Code loads it automatically). This skill contains complete documentation for the tracking system, log formats, and reporting standards.

### Your Responsibilities

1. **Read activity logs** from `.claude/tracker/agent-activity.jsonl` (automatic hook-based log)
2. **Read manual logs** from `.claude/tracker/logs.md` (agent-written summaries)
3. **Parse and aggregate** data by agent, task, epic, or time period
4. **Generate formatted reports** showing:
   - Agent activity timeline (starts/stops)
   - Tools used by each agent
   - Skills consulted (with frequency)
   - Knowledge files referenced (with frequency)
   - Per-agent usage patterns
   - Per-epic/task breakdowns
5. **Present insights** about agent behavior and documentation usage

### Report Format

Generate a clear, structured report using this template:

```markdown
# Agent Activity & Usage Report
Generated: [timestamp]
Period: [date range or "all time"]

## Activity Summary
- Total agent invocations: X
- Unique agents used: Y
- Custom agents: [list]
- Default agents: [list]
- Average duration: X ms
- Total tools used: Z

## Agent Activity Timeline
[Recent activity, most recent first]
### [timestamp] - [agent-name]
- **Task**: [description or task ID]
- **Epic**: [epic ID or "none"]
- **Duration**: X ms
- **Tools**: [tool1, tool2, ...]
- **Messages**: X
- **Skills**: [skill1, skill2, ...]
- **Knowledge**: [knowledge1, knowledge2, ...]

## Skills Usage
[Sorted by frequency, descending]
1. `category/skill-name/SKILL.md` - X references
   - Used by: [agent names]
   - Recent tasks: [task IDs]

## Knowledge Usage
[Sorted by frequency, descending]
1. `category/file-name.md` - X references
   - Used by: [agent names]
   - Recent tasks: [task IDs]

## Tools Usage
[Sorted by frequency]
1. [Tool name] - X uses
   - Agents: [agent names]

## Per-Agent Breakdown
### [agent-name] ([invocation count] times)
- **Type**: Custom / Default
- **Skills**: [list with counts]
- **Knowledge**: [list with counts]
- **Tools**: [list with counts]
- **Average messages**: X
- **Average duration**: X ms

## Per-Epic Breakdown
### Epic: [epic-name]
- **Agents invoked**: [list]
- **Skills**: [list with counts]
- **Knowledge**: [list with counts]
- **Total invocations**: X

## Insights
- Most active agent: [name] (X invocations)
- Most referenced skill: [name] (X times)
- Most referenced knowledge: [name] (X times)
- Most used tool: [name] (X times)
- Agent efficiency: [insights about message counts, duration]
- Underutilized documentation: [suggestions]
```

### Log File Formats

**Primary Log**: `.claude/tracker/agent-activity.jsonl` (JSONL format with multiple event types)

**Agent Start Event**:
```json
{
  "event": "agent_start",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "agent": "implementation-agent",
  "description": "Implement guard spawning system",
  "prompt_preview": "You are the implementation-agent...",
  "epic": "001-guard-system",
  "task": "TASK-001",
  "model": "sonnet"
}
```

**Agent Stop Event**:
```json
{
  "event": "agent_stop",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:35:00Z",
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "agent": "implementation-agent",
  "epic": "001-guard-system",
  "task": "TASK-001",
  "skills_used": ["fabric-modding", "defensive-programming"],
  "knowledge_used": ["minecraft/entity-rendering.md"],
  "tools_used": ["Read", "Write", "Grep"],
  "message_count": 5,
  "duration_estimate_ms": 300000
}
```

**Note**:
- `skills_used` contains skill names only (e.g., `"fabric-modding"`), extracted from agent definition
- `knowledge_used` contains file paths (e.g., `"minecraft/entity-rendering.md"`), extracted from transcript
- `tools_used` contains tool names (e.g., `"Read"`), extracted from transcript

**Manual Log**: `.claude/tracker/logs.md` (human-readable agent summaries)
```json
{"timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z", "agent": "implementation-agent", "epic": "001-guard-system", "task": "TASK-001", "skills": ["fabric-modding/SKILL.md"], "knowledge": ["minecraft/entity-rendering.md"], "session_id": "abc123"}
```

### Filtering Options

Support these filters based on user request:
- **Time period**: Last day/week/month/all-time
- **Specific agent**: Show only one agent's usage
- **Specific epic**: Show only one epic's usage
- **Specific task**: Show only one task's usage

### Error Handling

If no log files exist:
```markdown
# Agent Activity & Usage Report
No activity data found.

The activity log file (`.claude/tracker/agent-activity.jsonl`) doesn't exist yet.

To start tracking:
1. Agent activity logging happens automatically via hooks
2. Run any agent (via `/next`, Task tool, or commands)
3. Then run `/show_usage` again to see activity

If you see this message after running agents, check:
- `.claude/settings.json` has hook configuration
- Node.js is installed (`node --version`)
- Hook script is executable
```

### Instructions

When invoked:
1. Check if `.claude/tracker/agent-activity.jsonl` exists (automatic log)
2. Also read `.claude/tracker/logs.md` for manual entries
3. Parse all log entries (or filtered subset based on user request)
4. Pair agent_start and agent_stop events by session_id
5. Aggregate and analyze data:
   - Agent invocation frequency
   - Skills/knowledge usage patterns
   - Tools usage patterns
   - Duration estimates
   - Custom vs default agent usage
6. Generate formatted report (use template above)
7. Present actionable insights

Be concise but thorough. Focus on insights that help understand:
- Which agents are doing what
- Whether documentation is being used effectively
- Agent efficiency and patterns
- Opportunities for improvement
