# Coding Standards Examples

This directory contains detailed examples and patterns for Java coding standards.

## Purpose

The main `SKILL.md` file provides quick reference for coding standards. This `examples/` directory contains comprehensive implementations and detailed patterns.

## Available Examples

The following example files are referenced from the main skill:

1. **package-organization.md** - Complete package structure with detailed rules and dependency guidelines
2. **code-style.md** - Formatting examples, good vs bad code comparisons
3. **javadoc-examples.md** - Complete Javadoc examples for classes, methods, fields
4. **mixin-examples.md** - Mixin patterns with complete implementations
5. **client-server-separation.md** - Client/server separation examples and anti-patterns
6. **architecture-patterns.md** - Singleton, Factory, Builder pattern implementations
7. **error-handling.md** - Validation patterns, exception handling, fail-fast examples
8. **security-validation.md** - Server-side validation, range checking, permission patterns
9. **version-control.md** - Commit message guidelines, branch naming conventions

## Creating Examples

When creating example files:
- Include complete code examples (not fragments)
- Show both ✅ GOOD and ❌ BAD patterns
- Explain WHY each pattern is good or bad
- Use real-world Minecraft modding scenarios
- Keep examples focused and practical

## Usage

Example files are created on-demand as needed. The main `SKILL.md` provides enough guidance for most cases. Refer to examples when:
- Learning a new pattern for the first time
- Need detailed implementation guidance
- Teaching others the standards
- Reviewing complex code

Example files can be added incrementally by the implementation-agent or ai-agent as patterns emerge and are refined through actual mod development.
