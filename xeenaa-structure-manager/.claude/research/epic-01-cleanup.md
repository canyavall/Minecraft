# Epic 01 - Code Cleanup Documentation

**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Purpose**: Clean separation between old optimization code and Epic 01 research

---

## What Was Cleaned Up

### Archived Code (Moved to `.claude/archive/pre-epic01-code/`)

**Why Archived**: These systems were built prematurely before understanding the actual performance bottleneck. Epic 01 is research-first, so we archived optimization code to avoid confusion.

#### 1. Classification System (6 files)
- `classification/SizeCategory.java`
- `classification/TypeCategory.java`
- `classification/StructureClassification.java`
- `classification/ClassificationCache.java`
- `classification/SizeClassifier.java`
- `classification/TypeClassifier.java`
- `classification/ClassificationSystem.java`

**Purpose**: Automatically classify structures by size and type
**Status**: Archived - built before understanding if classification is needed

#### 2. Config System (3 files)
- `config/PresetType.java`
- `config/StructureConfig.java`
- `config/ConfigManager.java`

**Purpose**: User configuration for structure multipliers
**Status**: Archived - premature configuration without data

#### 3. Optimization Mixins (2 files)
- `mixin/StructurePlacementCalculatorMixin.java` - Applied multipliers to structure spacing
- `mixin/RandomSpreadStructurePlacementAccessor.java` - Accessor for private fields

**Purpose**: Modify structure placement spacing/separation
**Status**: Archived - optimization before measurement

#### 4. Client Code (1 file)
- `client/StructureManagerClient.java`

**Purpose**: Client-side initialization
**Status**: Archived - not needed for Epic 01 research

## What Was Kept (Active in Epic 01)

### Measurement & Tracking Systems

These systems are PERFECT for Epic 01 because they help us understand and measure performance without changing behavior.

#### 1. PlacementTracker.java
**Purpose**: Records every structure placement during worldgen
**Why Keep**: Essential for measuring placement rates and spacing
**Use in Epic 01**:
- TASK-004: Compare vanilla vs modded placement rates
- TASK-006: Analyze which structures place most frequently

#### 2. PlacementRecord.java
**Purpose**: Data structure for individual placement records
**Why Keep**: Supports PlacementTracker
**Use in Epic 01**: Calculate distances, timing, and statistics

#### 3. XeenaaCommand.java
**Purpose**: `/xeenaa stats` and `/xeenaa clear` commands
**Why Keep**: User-friendly way to view tracking data
**Use in Epic 01**: View placement statistics after tests

#### 4. StructureStartPlaceMixin.java
**Purpose**: Hooks into structure placement to record events
**Why Keep**: Non-intrusive tracking hook
**Use in Epic 01**: Powers PlacementTracker system

## Code Changes Made

### 1. StructureManagerMod.java - Simplified
**Before**: 400 lines with classification, config, world scanning, memory analysis
**After**: 65 lines - only command registration

**Removed**:
- Classification system initialization
- Config system initialization
- World load hook for structure scanning
- Memory consumption analysis
- Duplicate structure analysis

**Kept**:
- Command registration
- Simple initialization logging

### 2. xeenaa-structure-manager.mixins.json - Reduced
**Before**: 3 mixins
```json
"mixins": [
  "RandomSpreadStructurePlacementAccessor",
  "StructurePlacementCalculatorMixin",
  "StructureStartPlaceMixin"
]
```

**After**: 1 mixin (tracking only)
```json
"mixins": [
  "StructureStartPlaceMixin"
]
```

### 3. fabric.mod.json - No Changes
Already clean - no client entrypoint was registered

## Archive Location

All archived code stored in:
```
.claude/archive/pre-epic01-code/src/main/java/com/canya/xeenaa_structure_manager/
├── classification/
├── config/
├── client/
├── mixin/
│   ├── StructurePlacementCalculatorMixin.java
│   └── RandomSpreadStructurePlacementAccessor.java
└── StructureManagerMod.java (original version)
```

**Easy to restore**: If Epic 02+ needs this code, it's all saved and organized.

## Epic 01 Benefits

### Before Cleanup
- ❌ Confusing: Both optimization code AND tracking code running
- ❌ Hard to isolate: Can't tell if measurements are affected by optimizations
- ❌ Premature: Built solutions without understanding the problem

### After Cleanup
- ✅ Clear focus: Only measurement systems active
- ✅ Pure research: No optimizations affecting results
- ✅ Clean baseline: Can measure vanilla behavior accurately
- ✅ Organized: Easy to see what's active vs archived

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run `./gradlew build`** - Verify mod compiles cleanly
2. **Test in Minecraft** - Ensure PlacementTracker still works
3. **Begin Epic 01 TASK-001** - Start algorithm research with clean codebase
4. **Reference archive** - If needed, reference old code from archive folder

---

## Notes

- **Mods kept**: All downloaded mods untouched (no re-download needed)
- **Research kept**: All `.claude/research/` and `.claude/temp/` files preserved
- **Epics kept**: `.claude/epics/` structure intact
- **Build config kept**: `build.gradle` unchanged

**Result**: Clean, focused codebase ready for Epic 01 research!
