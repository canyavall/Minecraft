# Root Cause Analysis: Why 569 Structures Cause Performance Issues

**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Data Sources**: Performance test logs, ChatGPT analysis, DeepSeek analysis, our research files
**Purpose**: Concise identification of ROOT CAUSES (not symptoms)

---

## ROOT CAUSE #1: Structure Search Space Explosion (PRIMARY CULPRIT)

**What Happens**: Every chunk checks EVERY structure for placement eligibility.

**The Math**:
- Vanilla: 34 structures × placement checks per chunk
- Our test: 569 structures × placement checks per chunk
- **17x more checks per chunk**

**Real Issue**:
- Each check runs spacing calculation (salt + random + coordinate math)
- Most checks return "no" but still consume CPU time
- Synchronous main-thread operation (blocks worldgen pipeline)

**Evidence**:
- ChatGPT: "Every chunk triggers 20-100+ checks and random evaluations"
- DeepSeek: "The #1 culprit... N times more checks per chunk than vanilla"
- Our research: "STRUCTURE_START must complete for ALL surrounding chunks before next stages"

---

## ROOT CAUSE #2: STRUCTURE_START Stage Synchronization Bottleneck

**What Happens**: Structure layout generation blocks ALL downstream worldgen stages.

**The Process**:
1. Chunk generates → triggers STRUCTURE_START stage
2. For each structure attempting placement: generate jigsaw layout, create bounding boxes, check intersections
3. **ALL surrounding chunks MUST wait** for STRUCTURE_START to complete
4. Only then can BIOMES, NOISE, FEATURES, LIGHT stages proceed

**Real Issue**:
- STRUCTURE_START takes 20-40% of total worldgen time (measured)
- With 569 structures, more placement attempts = longer blocking time
- Creates cascading delays in parallel worldgen pipeline

**Evidence**:
- Our research: "STRUCTURE_START creates synchronization point in otherwise parallel pipeline"
- DeepSeek: "CPU bottleneck during chunk generation and structure placement phase"
- Performance test: Placement rate fluctuated 10-87 placements/sec (indicates blocking)

---

## ROOT CAUSE #3: Jigsaw Structure Assembly Complexity (O(n²) Intersection Checks)

**What Happens**: Each structure piece checks collision with every other piece during assembly.

**The Algorithm**:
```
For each structure piece (n pieces):
  For each other piece (n-1 pieces):
    Check bounding box intersection (O(1))
  Total: O(n²) per structure
```

**Real Issue**:
- Large structures (dungeons, mansions) have 50-200 pieces
- 200 pieces = 40,000 intersection checks per structure
- With 2,600 structures placed in 8 minutes, that's **104 million checks**

**Evidence**:
- Our research: "Jigsaw intersection checks (O(n²) complexity per structure)"
- DeepSeek: "A massive, multi-piece structure with complex jigsaws is more performance-intensive"
- ChatGPT: "Procedural structures... CPU-intensive during worldgen"

---

## ROOT CAUSE #4: Excessive Structure Placement Attempts (Vanilla Spacing with 17x Structures)

**What Happens**: Too many structures attempting to place in limited space.

**The Numbers**:
- Vanilla: ~20-30 structure placements per exploration session
- Our test: **2,600 structure placements in 8 minutes**
- **87x more placements than vanilla**

**Real Issue**:
- Spacing multipliers NOT applied (config bug)
- 569 structures all using vanilla spacing = extreme density
- Each placement triggers expensive STRUCTURE_START + jigsaw assembly

**Evidence**:
- Performance test: "2,600+ structures placed in 8 minutes"
- Log analysis: "mineshaft_icy #1-51 placed in seconds at SAME chunk"
- Config logs: "Global spacing (1.0) must be greater than separation (1.0), using defaults" → **defaults NOT applied**

---

## ROOT CAUSE #5: Memory Pressure from Rapid Structure Generation

**What Happens**: Generating 2,600 structures in 8 minutes creates GC pressure.

**The Pattern**:
- Memory usage: 1,667 MB → 4,860 MB (highly variable)
- Each structure creates: bounding boxes, piece lists, NBT data, loot tables
- Rapid allocation → frequent garbage collection → frame drops

**Real Issue**:
- Not structure COUNT itself (569 structures = 250 KB registry)
- **Placement RATE** causing allocation spikes
- GC pauses freeze rendering (visible as "computer struggling")

**Evidence**:
- Performance test: Memory fluctuated 1.6 GB to 4.8 GB
- ChatGPT: "Memory footprint especially during worldgen caching"
- User report: "Computer was having issues to render so many things"

---

## ROOT CAUSE #6: Biome Check Overhead (Secondary Factor)

**What Happens**: Each structure checks "can I spawn in this biome?" before attempting placement.

**The Process**:
- 569 structures registered
- Biome filtering reduces to ~80-400 compatible per chunk (depends on biome)
- Still 2-12x more checks than vanilla (34 structures)

**Real Issue**:
- Filtering happens in StructurePlacementCalculator (one-time per dimension load)
- BUT custom biome tags require more complex lookups than vanilla
- Structure mods often use specific/custom biome tags

**Evidence**:
- DeepSeek: "Complex Biome Tags... require more complex lookups than vanilla biomes"
- ChatGPT: "More lookups when Minecraft asks 'what structures can appear in this biome?'"
- Our research: "Biome filtering happens ONCE per dimension load" (not per-chunk, so impact is minimal)

---

## ROOT CAUSE #7: Mixin Overhead from Multiple Structure Mods

**What Happens**: Each structure mod patches worldgen pipeline with mixins.

**The Compounding**:
- 13 structure mods installed
- Many use mixins on same methods (StructurePlacementCalculator, ChunkGenerator, etc.)
- Each mixin adds method call overhead and conflict resolution

**Real Issue**:
- Mixin dispatch adds CPU cycles (small per call, but millions of calls)
- Overlapping patches can cause redundant checks
- Not optimized for multi-mod scenarios

**Evidence**:
- ChatGPT: "Overlapping mixins in worldgen = Inefficiency and potential lag"
- DeepSeek: "Poorly coded structure mod can have disproportionate impact"
- Our mod list: 13 mods using YungsAPI + Repurposed Structures framework

---

## ROOT CAUSE #8: NBT Template Loading Overhead (I/O Bottleneck)

**What Happens**: Each structure loads NBT templates from disk during placement.

**The Process**:
1. Structure attempts placement
2. Minecraft loads NBT template file(s) from mod resources
3. Parses NBT, inflates structure pieces, applies randomization
4. Caches in memory (but first load is slow)

**Real Issue**:
- 2,600 structures placed = potentially 2,600 NBT loads (if unique)
- HDD/slow SSD becomes bottleneck
- 30x memory inflation per structure (research finding)

**Evidence**:
- ChatGPT: "Disk reads when generating new chunks... disk access time becomes bottleneck"
- Our research: "NBT template iteration overhead (30x memory inflation per structure)"
- DeepSeek: "Loading all of these increases disk reads"

---

## Summary: Why "569 Structures" is Too Many

**It's not just the NUMBER 569**, it's the **COMPOUNDING EFFECTS**:

1. **17x more placement checks** per chunk (569 vs 34)
2. **Longer STRUCTURE_START blocking** (20-40% of worldgen time)
3. **O(n²) jigsaw assembly** for each placed structure
4. **87x more actual placements** (2,600 in 8 min vs vanilla ~30)
5. **GC pressure** from rapid allocation (1.6 GB → 4.8 GB swings)
6. **2-12x biome checks** vs vanilla
7. **Mixin overhead** from 13 mods patching same methods
8. **I/O bottleneck** from NBT template loads

**The Kicker**: Our config multipliers **weren't applied**, so ALL 569 structures used vanilla spacing. This turned a "manageable with spacing" problem into "computer can't render" problem.

---

## What Our Mod SHOULD Fix

**Primary Goal**: Reduce placement ATTEMPTS by increasing spacing

**How it works**:
- Fewer attempts = less STRUCTURE_START work
- Less blocking = faster worldgen
- Less GC pressure = smoother rendering

**Target**: Reduce 2,600 placements/8min to ~200-400 placements/8min (6-13x reduction)

**Method**: Apply 2-5x spacing multipliers to most structures

**Expected Result**: Performance similar to vanilla despite 569 registered structures

---

## Next Steps: What We Need To Do

**Immediate**:
1. Fix config defaults bug (multipliers not applied)
2. Verify multiplier integration actually modifies structure spacing
3. Test with corrected config

**Verification**:
1. Run `/xeenaa stats` to compare expected vs actual spacing
2. Monitor placement rate (should drop to 10-30/sec from 87/sec)
3. Check memory stability (should stabilize around 2-3 GB)

**Success Criteria**:
- Placement count drops 80-90% (2,600 → 200-400 per session)
- Memory usage stabilizes (no 1.6→4.8 GB swings)
- User reports smooth rendering (no lag spikes)
