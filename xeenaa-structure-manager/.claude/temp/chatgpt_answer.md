Perfect — let’s dig deep into this 💪

When you add many structure mods (like YUNG’s, Better Desert Temples, When Dungeons Arise, Repurposed Structures, etc.) to Minecraft 1.21.1 Fabric, the slowdown you see mainly comes from how world generation works internally — especially structure locating, biome decoration, and chunk population.

Let’s break down exactly why:

🧱 1. Structure mods increase worldgen complexity per chunk

Each structure mod registers many Structure Features with their own:

Placement rules (e.g., "generate in plains or deserts every 40 chunks"),

Pools of pieces (for modular structures),

Randomization logic (loot, mobs, layout),

And biome checks.

When Minecraft generates a new chunk, it runs through all registered structures to check “Should this structure generate here?”

If you have 20+ structure mods:

Every chunk triggers 20–100+ checks and random evaluations.

Even though most structures don’t spawn, those checks still run — and they compound heavily during worldgen, especially while exploring new terrain.

⚙️ 2. The “Structure Start” scanning becomes heavier

Minecraft uses a “structure start” system — it precomputes potential structure positions based on configured placement spacing and separation.

Each structure adds an entry in the StructureSet registry.
During chunk generation, the game has to iterate through all these sets to find potential matches.

This scanning is synchronous, meaning it happens on the main thread.
→ Result: noticeable TPS drops, worldgen lag spikes, or stutter when exploring.

🌍 3. Some structure mods have heavy procedural generation

Mods like When Dungeons Arise, Towns and Towers, or BetterStrongholds generate massive, detailed structures with hundreds of blocks, loot chests, and mob spawners.

These are often built dynamically at worldgen time:

Randomized layouts,

Pathfinding validation (e.g., connecting rooms properly),

Custom loot tables and mob setups.

Those are CPU-intensive — especially since worldgen isn’t multi-threaded for most of it.

🧩 4. Increased biome and structure registry lookups

Each structure mod usually comes with its own data pack definitions and biome tags, which means:

More lookups when Minecraft asks “what structures can appear in this biome?”

Longer load time at startup (since it builds all these registries),

And more memory use, since every structure piece and loot table must be cached.

🪓 5. More structure mods = more I/O and memory load

Big structure mods often include:

Thousands of NBT templates or Jigsaw files,

Custom block palettes,

Custom loot tables.

Loading all of these increases:

Memory footprint (especially during worldgen caching),

Disk reads when generating new chunks.

If you’re using a HDD or slower SSD, that disk access time becomes a bottleneck.

💡 6. Fabric specifics (1.21.1)

Fabric itself is lightweight, but most structure mods rely on:

Fabric API (for structure registration),

Terrablender or Biome API hooks,

Sometimes Mixin-heavy patches to the worldgen pipeline.

Each mixin adds a bit of overhead to the chunk generation process, and if several structure mods all patch the same systems, you can get conflict resolution costs or redundant checks.

🧠 Summary
Cause	Effect
Too many structure checks per chunk	CPU overhead during generation
Procedural structures	Lag spikes when generating
Multiple biome tags and data packs	Longer world load times
Jigsaw and loot template loading	Memory and I/O overhead
Overlapping mixins in worldgen	Inefficiency and potential lag
