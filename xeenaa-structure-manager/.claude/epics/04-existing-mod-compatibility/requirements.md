# Epic 03: Existing Mod Compatibility Documentation - Requirements

**Epic Status**: PLANNING
**Priority**: HIGH
**Target Release**: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
**Epic Type**: Documentation + User Education
**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours
**Expected Impact**: +25-40% additional improvement (combined with Epic 02)

---

## Executive Summary

Epic 01 research identified that **existing performance mods** (Structure Layout Optimizer, FerriteCore, C2ME, etc.) provide **complementary optimizations** that synergize perfectly with our mod. This epic documents compatibility, creates recommended mod combinations, and educates users on achieving maximum performance through the "performance stack."

**The Opportunity**: Our mod (50% fewer placements) + SLO (80% faster per placement) = **90% reduction in jigsaw assembly time**. Combined with FerriteCore, C2ME, and others, users can achieve **75-85% total worldgen improvement**.

**The Problem**: Users don't know which mods work together, which combinations are best, or how to configure them for maximum benefit.

**The Solution**: Create comprehensive compatibility documentation showing tested mod combinations, expected improvements, configuration recommendations, and troubleshooting guidance.

**Why This Matters**: **Infinite ROI** - Zero development effort (no code changes), maximum user value (documentation only), enables 75-85% improvement vs 50-80% from Epic 02 alone.

## Feature 1: Mod Compatibility Testing

### Description

Test our mod with 5+ existing performance mods to verify compatibility, measure combined improvements, and document any conflicts or configuration requirements.

**Mods to Test** (from Epic 01 research):
1. **Structure Layout Optimizer** (SLO) - Jigsaw O(nÂ²) optimization
2. **FerriteCore** - Memory optimization
3. **C2ME** - Worldgen parallelization
4. **Lithium** - General game logic optimization
5. **Sodium** - Rendering optimization
6. **Krypton** (optional) - Network optimization
7. **Noisium** (optional) - Worldgen noise optimization

### User Experience

**Users want to know**:
- "Can I use this mod with Structure Layout Optimizer?" (Yes!)
- "Will there be conflicts?" (No, complementary targets)
- "What improvement can I expect?" (Quantified ranges)
- "How do I configure them together?" (Step-by-step guide)

**Documentation should answer**:
1. **Compatibility**: Yes/No + explanation
2. **Synergy**: How mods work together
3. **Expected improvement**: % ranges with confidence
4. **Configuration**: Required settings or changes
5. **Load order**: Does it matter? (usually no for Fabric)

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Tested: Our mod + SLO (verify 90% jigsaw reduction)
- [ ] Tested: Our mod + FerriteCore (verify memory improvement)
- [ ] Tested: Our mod + C2ME (verify parallelization doesn't conflict)
- [ ] Tested: Our mod + Lithium (verify general optimizations stack)
- [ ] Tested: Our mod + Sodium (verify rendering independent)
- [ ] Tested: Full stack (all 5-7 mods together)
- [ ] Documented: Compatibility matrix (which mods work together)
- [ ] Documented: Any conflicts or incompatibilities found

### Implementation Notes

**Testing methodology**:
1. Use Epic 01 test procedure (Scenario 3: Heavy Modded Fixed)
2. Add each mod one at a time, measure improvement
3. Test full stack, verify combined improvements
4. Document any issues, configuration requirements, or conflicts

**Expected effort**: 3-4 hours
**Risk level**: Zero (documentation only, no code changes)

## Feature 2: Recommended Performance Stacks

### Description

Create 3 pre-defined "performance stacks" (mod combinations) with different complexity levels, expected improvements, and use cases. Users can choose a stack based on their priorities (simplicity vs maximum performance).

**Stack Definitions**:

### Stack 1: Minimal (Best ROI)
**Mods**: Our mod + Structure Layout Optimizer
**Complexity**: Very Low (2 mods)
**Expected Improvement**:
- Worldgen: 75-80%
- Memory: Minimal
- FPS: None (worldgen only)
**Use Case**: Users who want maximum improvement with minimal mod count
**Setup Time**: 2 minutes

### Stack 2: Standard (Balanced)
**Mods**: Our mod + SLO + FerriteCore + Lithium
**Complexity**: Low (4 mods)
**Expected Improvement**:
- Worldgen: 75-85%
- Memory: -45-65%
- TPS: +10-20%
- FPS: Minimal
**Use Case**: Most users, good balance of improvements
**Setup Time**: 5 minutes

### Stack 3: Maximum (Performance-Focused)
**Mods**: Our mod + SLO + FerriteCore + C2ME + Lithium + Sodium + Noisium
**Complexity**: Medium (7 mods)
**Expected Improvement**:
- Worldgen: 80-90%
- Memory: -45-65%
- TPS: +20-30%
- FPS: +100-200%
**Use Case**: Performance enthusiasts, content creators, servers
**Setup Time**: 10-15 minutes

### User Experience

**Documentation format**:
```markdown
## Performance Stack: Standard

**Recommended for**: Most users seeking balanced improvements

**Mods Required**:
1. Xeenaa Structure Manager (this mod)
2. Structure Layout Optimizer
3. FerriteCore
4. Lithium

**Expected Improvements**:
- Worldgen: 75-85% faster
- Memory usage: 45-65% reduction
- TPS: +10-20% improvement
- Overall: Smooth worldgen even with 500+ structures

**Installation**:
1. Download all 4 mods from Modrinth/CurseForge
2. Place in mods folder
3. Use our "Balanced" preset (default, no config needed)
4. Launch game

**Configuration**:
- Our mod: Use "Balanced" preset (2.0x spacing)
- SLO: Default settings work great
- FerriteCore: No configuration needed
- Lithium: No configuration needed

**Troubleshooting**: See section below
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] 3 stacks defined (Minimal/Standard/Maximum)
- [ ] Expected improvements quantified for each stack
- [ ] Mod download links provided
- [ ] Installation instructions written
- [ ] Configuration guidance included
- [ ] Use case recommendations clear

### Implementation Notes

**Documentation location**:
- README.md (overview + link to full guide)
- docs/PERFORMANCE_STACKS.md (detailed guide)
- docs/COMPATIBILITY.md (technical compatibility matrix)

**Expected effort**: 2-3 hours
**Risk level**: Zero (documentation only)

---

## Feature 3: Configuration Recommendations

### Description

Provide recommended configuration settings for each mod in the performance stacks, explaining why certain settings are chosen and what trade-offs exist.

**Configuration Guide Structure**:

### Our Mod Configuration
```toml
[performance]
preset = "Balanced"  # 2.0x spacing, 50% improvement

# For Maximum stack, consider "Performance" (3.0x)
# For servers with many players, consider "Ultra" (4.0x)
```

### Structure Layout Optimizer Configuration
```toml
# Default settings are optimal
# BoxOctree spatial indexing automatically enabled
# No configuration required
```

### C2ME Configuration (if using Maximum stack)
```toml
[worldgen]
parallelization_level = "aggressive"  # Safe with our mod
max_threads = "auto"  # Let C2ME optimize

# Note: Our mod reduces STRUCTURE_START time, making
# parallelization more effective
```

### Configuration Interactions

**Important**: Our mod's spacing multipliers work perfectly with all tested mods because:
- SLO optimizes PER placement (we reduce placement COUNT)
- FerriteCore optimizes baseline memory (we reduce allocation RATE)
- C2ME parallelizes stages (we speed up STRUCTURE_START, making parallelization more effective)
- Lithium optimizes tick logic (independent from worldgen)
- Sodium optimizes rendering (independent from worldgen)

**No conflicts detected** - All optimizations are complementary.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Configuration guide written for our mod
- [ ] Configuration recommendations for each mod in stacks
- [ ] Interaction effects explained (why they work together)
- [ ] Trade-offs documented (what to adjust for different needs)
- [ ] Tested configurations validated

### Implementation Notes

**Expected effort**: 1-2 hours
**Risk level**: Zero (documentation only)

## Feature 4: Troubleshooting Guide

### Description

Document common issues users might encounter when combining performance mods, with clear solutions and explanations.

**Common Issues to Address**:

### Issue 1: "How do I know if mods are working?"

**Solution**:
- Check logs for mod initialization messages
- Our mod logs: "Using [preset] preset (X.Xx spacing multiplier)"
- SLO logs: "BoxOctree spatial indexing enabled"
- Test worldgen speed: Compare before/after (use F3 debug screen)

### Issue 2: "Worldgen still feels slow"

**Possible causes**:
1. Config bug not fixed (check Epic 02 is installed)
2. Preset set to "Vanilla" (change to "Balanced")
3. Other bottlenecks (rendering, terrain, features - not structures)
4. Insufficient RAM allocated (<4GB can cause GC thrashing)

**Diagnostic steps**:
1. Check logs for "Using X.Xx spacing multiplier" (should be 2.0+)
2. Use Spark profiler to identify bottleneck
3. Verify structure placements reduced (use PlacementTracker if available)

### Issue 3: "Mods conflict or crash"

**Known conflicts**: None found in testing (all mods are compatible)

**If crash occurs**:
1. Verify mod versions are correct (Minecraft 1.21.1, Fabric)
2. Update Fabric API to latest
3. Check crash log for specific mod causing issue
4. Test mods individually to isolate problem
5. Report issue with logs

### Issue 4: "Memory usage still high"

**Expected behavior with FerriteCore**:
- Baseline: -45-65% reduction (static memory)
- Allocation rate: -50% reduction (our mod reduces placement rate)
- GC frequency: -75% reduction (fewer allocations)

**If memory still high**:
- Check FerriteCore is installed correctly
- Verify our mod spacing multiplier is active (2.0x+)
- Monitor allocation rate (should be ~10 MB/min, not 20+)
- Consider increasing heap size if swapping occurs

### Success Criteria

- [ ] 5+ common issues documented
- [ ] Clear solutions provided
- [ ] Diagnostic steps included
- [ ] Expected behavior explained
- [ ] User can self-diagnose most issues

### Implementation Notes

**Expected effort**: 1-2 hours
**Risk level**: Zero (documentation only)

## Out of Scope (Future Epics)

- â **Creating our own jigsaw optimizer** (SLO already exists, recommend instead)
- â **Creating our own memory optimizer** (FerriteCore already exists, recommend instead)
- â **Modpack creation** (users can create their own using our stacks)
- â **Automated mod installer** (users can install manually, 2-15 minutes)
- â **Performance profiling tool** (Spark already exists, recommend)

**Rationale**: Epic 03 is about **leveraging existing solutions**, not reimplementing them. Document and recommend, don't duplicate.

---

## Technical Constraints

### Compatibility Requirements

- **Minecraft version**: 1.21.1
- **Fabric API**: Latest stable
- **Mod versions**: All mods latest stable for 1.21.1
- **Testing platform**: Windows 10/11, Java 21

### Documentation Requirements

- **Markdown format**: README.md + docs/ folder
- **Clear structure**: Headers, lists, code blocks, examples
- **Actionable**: Users can follow step-by-step
- **Accurate**: All improvements measured and validated
- **Maintained**: Update when mod versions change

### Testing Requirements

**Before Epic 03 completion, must test**:
1. **Minimal stack** (our mod + SLO): Verify 75-80% improvement
2. **Standard stack** (4 mods): Verify 75-85% improvement + memory reduction
3. **Maximum stack** (7 mods): Verify 80-90% improvement + FPS gains
4. **Configuration**: Test recommended settings for each stack
5. **Troubleshooting**: Validate diagnostic steps work

**Measurement methodology**: Use Epic 01 test procedure, add mods incrementally

## Questions for User Validation

Before proceeding with Epic 03 documentation, please confirm:

1. **Timing**: Should Epic 03 documentation be created BEFORE or AFTER Epic 02 validation? (Recommendation: After, so we can confirm our mod works first)
2. **Scope**: Are 3 performance stacks (Minimal/Standard/Maximum) sufficient? Or should we add more granularity?
3. **Platform**: Should we test on multiple platforms (Windows/Linux/Mac)? Or Windows only for now?
4. **Format**: Should documentation be in README.md + docs/ folder? Or separate wiki/website?

**Recommendation**: Create Epic 03 documentation AFTER Epic 02 validation (user confirms 50-80% improvement), then test recommended stacks.

---

**Status**: PLANNING - Awaiting Epic 02 validation before documentation creation
