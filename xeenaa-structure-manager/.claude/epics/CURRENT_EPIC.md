## Currently Active Epic

**Epic 01: Comprehensive Performance Research** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: COMPLETED (12/12 tasks, 100%)

**Epic Goal**:
Research and measure ALL performance bottlenecks when 500+ structures are loaded, then create a data-driven roadmap for Epic 02-08+ optimization work.

**What Epic 01 Delivered**:
1. ✅ Complete algorithm documentation (placement-algorithm.md, code-references.md)
2. ✅ Comprehensive profiling data (Spark profiler, memory analysis, per-structure costs)
3. ✅ Baseline comparisons (vanilla vs heavy modded, 2,600 placements measured)
4. ✅ Existing solutions research (9 mods analyzed, 6 techniques cataloged)
5. ✅ Optimization decision matrix (18 techniques scored, Epic 02 recommendation)
6. ✅ Executive summary (all research questions answered)

**Key Findings**:
- **PRIMARY BOTTLENECK**: STRUCTURE_START (40-60% of worldgen time, 10x slower than vanilla)
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Config validation bug causes 100x placement explosion (2,600 vs 200-400 expected)
- **SECONDARY BOTTLENECK**: Jigsaw assembly O(n²) (20-30% of STRUCTURE_START, addressed by SLO mod)
- **MEMORY**: Symptom not cause (r² = 0.98 correlation with placement rate)
- **GRID CHECKS**: NOT a bottleneck (0.02% of time, already optimal)

**Epic 02 Recommendation**: Fix config bug + add presets (ROI 10.0, 50-80% improvement in <6 hours)

## Epic 02: Config Fix and Performance Presets ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: COMPLETED (5/5 tasks, 100%)

**Epic Goal**:
Fix the critical config validation bug that prevents spacing multipliers from applying, and add 4 user-friendly performance presets for easy optimization access.

**Expected Impact**:
- 50-80% worldgen improvement (Balanced preset with 2.0x multiplier)
- "Struggled" → "Smooth" user experience
- One-click preset selection (no technical knowledge required)

**Implementation Plan**:
- 5 tasks (TASK-001 through TASK-005)
- Phases: Foundation → Implementation → Integration → Testing → User Validation
- Effort: 5-8 hours total
- Risk: Zero (config-only changes)
- ROI: 10.0 (highest in Epic 01 catalog)

**Completion Summary**:
- ✅ TASK-001: Fix Config Validation Bug (COMPLETED)
- ✅ TASK-002: Implement Preset Enum and Mapping (COMPLETED)
- ✅ TASK-003: Add Startup Performance Metrics Logging (COMPLETED - already comprehensive)
- ✅ TASK-004: Comprehensive Testing and Validation (COMPLETED - manual validation successful)
- ✅ TASK-005: User Manual Testing and Validation (COMPLETED - validated in-game)

**What Epic 02 Delivered**:
- ✅ Config system with NightConfig TOML integration
- ✅ 4 performance presets (Vanilla/Balanced/Performance/Ultra)
- ✅ Custom multiplier override support
- ✅ Comprehensive validation (< 1.0, == 1.0, > 1.0 handled)
- ✅ Startup logging showing preset and multiplier
- ✅ User-validated in Minecraft (config loads correctly)

**Key Finding from User Testing**:
- Config system works perfectly (2.0x multiplier stored)
- RAM usage improved from 80% peaks to steady 50%
- **BUT**: Multiplier not yet applied to structure placement (expected!)
- Epic 02 was config-only - actual optimization comes in Epic 03+

## Next Epic: Epic 03 (Apply Spacing Multiplier to Placement)

**Status**: READY (6 tasks defined, ready to execute with `/next`)

**Epic Goal**:
Hook into Minecraft's structure placement algorithm to multiply spacing/separation values by the configured multiplier (2.0x from Epic 02 config). This reduces placement attempts by 75% and achieves the promised 50-80% worldgen improvement.

**Expected Impact**:
- Placement reduction: 2,600 → ~650 (75% fewer)
- STRUCTURE_START time: 50-60% reduction
- Memory usage: 50% → 20-30% (dramatic improvement)
- Worldgen speed: 50-80% faster (user-noticeable)
- User experience: "Struggled" → "Smooth"

**What Epic 02 Did** (config-only):
- ✅ Created config system
- ✅ Stored multiplier (2.0x)
- ❌ Did NOT apply to structure placement

**What Epic 03 Will Do** (the actual optimization):
- ✅ Apply multiplier to spacing calculations
- ✅ Apply multiplier to separation calculations
- ✅ Reduce placement attempts by 75%
- ✅ Achieve 50-80% worldgen improvement
- ✅ Validate with Epic 01 test procedure

**Implementation Plan**:
- TASK-001: Research structure placement code and identify injection point (2-3 hours)
- TASK-002: Implement spacing multiplier mixin (3-4 hours)
- TASK-003: Test with vanilla structures (1-2 hours)
- TASK-004: Test with modded structures (2-3 hours)
- TASK-005: Performance validation with Spark profiler (2-3 hours)
- TASK-006: User manual testing and validation (1-2 hours)

**Next step**: Run `/next` to begin TASK-001 (Research structure placement code)

## Next Steps

### For Epic 02 (Ready to Execute)

1. ✅ **Epic 02 requirements created**: requirements.md defines business value
2. ✅ **Epic 02 plan created**: plan.md defines 5 technical tasks
3. ✅ **Epic 03 created**: Existing mod compatibility documentation (75-85% combined improvement)
4. **Next step**: Run `/next` to begin TASK-001 (Fix Config Validation Bug)

### Epic 02 Execution Flow

1. **TASK-001** (1-2 hours): Fix config validation bug (prevent 1.0 from breaking optimization)
2. **TASK-002** (2-3 hours): Implement preset system (Vanilla/Balanced/Performance/Ultra)
3. **TASK-003** (1 hour): Add startup logging (show preset, improvement estimate)
4. **TASK-004** (1-2 hours): Automated testing (verify 40-60% improvement)
5. **TASK-005** (0.5-1 hour): User manual testing (feel the performance improvement)
6. **Epic 02 complete** → Proceed to Epic 03 (document existing mod compatibility)

### After Epic 02 Validation

- **Epic 03**: Document SLO + FerriteCore + C2ME compatibility (75-85% combined improvement)
- **Epic 04+**: Conditional on user feedback (per-structure overrides, classification system, etc.)

## Research Assets Already Available

**From Previous Work** (valuable, not wasted):
- ✅ Structure placement algorithm research (27,000+ word document from old TASK-001)
- ✅ Root cause analysis (8 bottlenecks identified and documented)
- ✅ External AI research (ChatGPT, DeepSeek analysis pasted)
- ✅ Performance test logs (2,600+ structure placements documented)
- ✅ PlacementTracker system (metrics collection code)
- ✅ Initial profiling data (Spark profiler results)

**These assets accelerate Epic 01** - we have a strong foundation to build on.

## Project Philosophy

**Core Principle**: **Measure twice, cut once**

We invest heavily in Epic 01 research because:
- ✅ **Prevents wasted effort** - No building wrong optimizations
- ✅ **Maximizes impact** - Fix the most important problems first
- ✅ **Sets realistic targets** - Know what's achievable
- ✅ **Builds confidence** - Data-backed decisions, not guesses
- ✅ **Creates roadmap** - Clear Epic 02-08+ priority order

**Development Approach**:
```
Epic 01: Research → Measure → Understand → Prioritize
Epic 02+: Implement → Measure → Validate → Iterate
```

## Performance Targets (To Be Validated in Epic 01)

**Minimum Viable Product**:
- 30-40% reduction in structure-related worldgen overhead

**Ideal Performance**:
- 50-70% reduction in structure-related worldgen overhead

**Success Metrics** (Epic 01 will establish baselines for these):
- STRUCTURE_START time: 50%+ reduction
- Chunk generation time: 30%+ reduction
- Memory usage: No increase (or reduction)
- GC pressure: 20%+ reduction
- TPS impact: Minimal during worldgen
- Compatibility: 100% with all structure mods

## Archive

**Old epics** (archived for reference):
- `archive/old-epic-01-20251025/` - Previous "Understanding Structure Search Bottleneck" epic
  - **Why archived**: Too narrow scope (focused only on search space, not comprehensive)
  - **What we kept**: Valuable research documents moved to new Epic 01 assets

---

**Status**: Epic 01 COMPLETED (12/12 tasks). Epic 02 READY (5 tasks defined). Epic 03 CREATED. Ready to execute with `/next`.
