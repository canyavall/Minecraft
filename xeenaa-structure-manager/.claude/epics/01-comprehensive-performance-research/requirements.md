# Epic 01: Comprehensive Structure Performance Research

**Epic Number**: 01
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: PLANNING
**Priority**: Critical
**Type**: Research & Measurement Epic

---

## Business Value

### Problem Statement

Players who install 10-15+ structure mods (creating 500+ total structures) experience **severe performance degradation** during world generation:

- **Lag spikes** during chunk generation
- **Slow world creation** (10-20x slower than vanilla)
- **Server unresponsiveness** when generating new chunks
- **Poor player experience** - frustration from stuttering and freezing

This makes it practically impossible to enjoy heavily modded Minecraft with multiple structure packs, forcing players to choose between variety and performance.

### Value Delivered

This epic provides the **complete knowledge foundation** needed to build a comprehensive performance optimization mod. By thoroughly researching ALL bottlenecks, measuring their impact, and investigating existing solutions, we can:

1. **Make informed decisions** about which optimizations deliver maximum value
2. **Avoid premature optimization** - fix the right problems, not assumed problems
3. **Learn from existing solutions** - understand what others have tried
4. **Build a data-driven roadmap** - prioritize epics 02-08+ based on measured impact
5. **Set realistic targets** - know what performance improvements are achievable

### Success Definition

We can confidently answer:
- **"What are ALL the performance bottlenecks when 500+ structures are loaded?"**
- **"Which bottleneck contributes MOST to performance problems?"**
- **"What optimization techniques exist and how effective are they?"**
- **"What should we build first to maximize player impact?"**
- **"What performance improvement can players realistically expect?"**

## Overview

This is a **pure research and measurement epic** - no optimization code will be written. Our goal is to **understand the complete performance problem** before attempting any solutions.

### Research Philosophy

**"Measure twice, cut once"** - We will invest time upfront to:
- Understand how Minecraft structure generation works (algorithm deep-dive)
- Identify ALL performance bottlenecks (not just obvious ones)
- Measure the actual cost of each bottleneck (profiling data)
- Research existing optimization techniques (mods, papers, techniques)
- Compare vanilla vs modded performance (baseline establishment)
- Prioritize optimization opportunities (impact vs effort analysis)

### Approach

**Phase 1: Algorithm Understanding**
- How does Minecraft decide "should this structure place here?"
- What is the complete placement pipeline?
- Which operations are expensive vs cheap?

**Phase 2: Bottleneck Identification**
- Profile vanilla (34 structures) vs modded (569 structures)
- Identify specific methods/operations consuming CPU time
- Measure memory allocation and GC pressure
- Find synchronization bottlenecks in worldgen pipeline

**Phase 3: Optimization Research**
- Study existing performance mods (Structure Layout Optimizer, Chunky, etc.)
- Research caching strategies used in similar contexts
- Investigate spatial data structures for optimization
- Review academic papers on procedural generation optimization

**Phase 4: Solution Prioritization**
- Rank all 8+ identified bottlenecks by measured impact
- Evaluate optimization techniques by feasibility and effectiveness
- Create decision matrix (Impact × Effort × Risk)
- Recommend Epic 02-08+ priority order

## Features

### Feature 1: Complete Algorithm Documentation

**Description**:
Comprehensive documentation of Minecraft's structure placement algorithm, from initial check through final placement.

**Research Deliverables**:
- Step-by-step algorithm explanation (readable by non-experts)
- Code flow diagrams showing decision trees
- Identification of expensive operations (with justification)
- Explanation of key systems: RandomSpreadStructurePlacement, STRUCTURE_START stage, jigsaw assembly, biome filtering
- Performance characteristics analysis (O(n), O(n²), etc.)

**Why This Matters**:
Without understanding HOW placement works, we can't optimize it effectively. This prevents wasted effort on wrong optimizations.

**Success Criteria**:
- Documentation clearly explains placement algorithm to someone unfamiliar with Minecraft internals
- Visual diagrams make the pipeline easy to understand
- Expensive vs cheap operations are identified with data/justification
- User can read documentation and understand "why 569 structures = slow"
- Research includes code references (file paths, line numbers) for verification

### Feature 2: Comprehensive Bottleneck Profiling

**Description**:
Detailed CPU and memory profiling identifying WHERE performance is lost when many structures are loaded.

**Profiling Deliverables**:
- Spark Profiler analysis (CPU time breakdown by method)
- Java Flight Recorder analysis (memory allocation, GC pressure)
- STRUCTURE_START stage timing measurements
- Per-structure performance cost data
- Top 10-20 most expensive operations identified
- Bottleneck contribution percentages (e.g., "Jigsaw assembly = 35% of overhead")

**Why This Matters**:
Assumptions about performance are often wrong. Profiling reveals the ACTUAL bottlenecks, not the assumed ones.

**Success Criteria**:
- Profiling data collected for both vanilla (34 structures) and modded (569 structures)
- Clear percentage breakdown of where time is spent
- Identification of primary, secondary, and tertiary bottlenecks
- Per-structure cost data available for identifying "expensive structures"
- Concrete numbers (milliseconds, percentages) for all findings
- Statistical validity (multiple test runs, consistent results)

---

### Feature 3: Baseline Performance Comparison

**Description**:
Establish quantitative performance baselines comparing vanilla, lightly modded, and heavily modded scenarios.

**Comparison Scenarios**:
1. **Vanilla Baseline** - 34 structures only (unmodded Minecraft)
2. **Light Modding** - ~100-150 structures (few structure mods)
3. **Heavy Modding** - 500-569 structures (10-15+ structure mods)

**Metrics Measured**:
- Chunk generation time (milliseconds per chunk)
- STRUCTURE_START stage time (percentage of total worldgen)
- Placement check count (per chunk)
- Memory usage during worldgen (heap consumption)
- GC frequency and pause time
- Structures placed per minute (throughput)

**Why This Matters**:
Baselines let us measure improvement objectively. Without them, we can't prove optimizations work.

**Success Criteria**:
- All 3 scenarios tested with consistent methodology
- Metrics table comparing scenarios side-by-side
- Performance degradation quantified (e.g., "569 structures = 15x slower worldgen")
- Clear identification of which metric degrades most severely
- Reproducible test procedure documented for retesting after optimizations
- Statistical significance confirmed (multiple runs, confidence intervals)

### Feature 4: Existing Solutions Research

**Description**:
Comprehensive research into existing performance mods, optimization techniques, and relevant academic work.

**Research Areas**:

**Existing Mods**:
- Structure Layout Optimizer (what does it do? how effective?)
- Chunky (pre-generation strategies)
- C2ME (multi-threading approaches)
- Other performance mods addressing worldgen

**Optimization Techniques**:
- Caching strategies (what to cache, when to invalidate)
- Spatial data structures (quadtrees, R-trees, BVH)
- Lazy evaluation patterns
- Object pooling and allocation reduction
- Algorithm improvements (better than O(n²) intersection checks)
- Asynchronous processing opportunities

**Academic/Industry Knowledge**:
- Procedural generation optimization papers
- Spatial query optimization (game engines, databases)
- Cache-friendly data structures
- Multi-threading patterns for worldgen

**Why This Matters**:
Don't reinvent the wheel. Learn from successful solutions and understand why they work.

**Success Criteria**:
- At least 5 existing mods researched with documented findings
- Optimization techniques categorized by type (caching, algorithms, threading, etc.)
- Each technique evaluated for applicability to our problem
- "Lessons learned" document summarizing key insights
- References to source code, papers, or documentation for each technique
- Clear identification of which techniques are most promising for our mod

### Feature 5: Optimization Decision Matrix

**Description**:
Data-driven prioritization of which optimizations to implement in Epic 02-08+, based on measured impact and estimated effort.

**Decision Framework**:
For each potential optimization (8+ identified bottlenecks):
- **Impact Score** (1-10): Based on profiling data - how much performance gain?
- **Effort Score** (1-10): Estimated implementation complexity
- **Risk Score** (1-10): Compatibility risk, maintenance burden
- **Priority Score**: Calculated from Impact, Effort, Risk

**Prioritization Outputs**:
- Ranked list of optimizations (highest to lowest priority)
- Recommended Epic 02 starting point with justification
- "Quick wins" identified (high impact, low effort)
- "Long-term investments" identified (high impact, high effort)
- "Low priority" optimizations documented (low impact or high risk)

**Why This Matters**:
We can't optimize everything at once. Prioritization ensures we deliver maximum value to players fastest.

**Success Criteria**:
- All 8+ bottlenecks evaluated with objective scores
- Impact scores directly tied to profiling data (not guesses)
- Clear recommendation: "Start with Epic XX because..."
- Justification includes specific numbers from profiling
- User can understand the reasoning and agree with priorities
- Roadmap for Epic 02-08+ clearly defined
