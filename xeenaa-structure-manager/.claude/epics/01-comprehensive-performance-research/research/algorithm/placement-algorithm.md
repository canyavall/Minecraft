## Executive Summary

**Quick Answer**: Minecraft's structure placement is a three-phase process:

1. **World Load** (one-time): Filter structures by dimension/biome, create placement calculator
2. **STRUCTURE_START** (per-chunk): Use grid-based algorithm to determine which structures attempt placement
3. **Placement** (after terrain): Generate structure pieces and place blocks

**The Bottleneck**: Phase 2 (STRUCTURE_START) runs for EVERY chunk and checks EVERY compatible structure using a grid calculation. With 569 structures instead of vanilla's 34, this creates **17x more work per chunk**.

**Why It Matters**: Understanding this pipeline explains:
- Why more structure mods = slower world generation
- Why spacing multipliers improve performance (reduce grid matches)
- Where optimization efforts should focus (STRUCTURE_START stage)

**Visual Summary**:
```
569 Structures → Dimension Filter → 400 Structures
                ↓
         Biome Filter → 80-150 Structure Sets
                ↓
         Grid Check (per chunk) → 5-20 Attempts
                ↓
         Biome Compatibility → 2-10 Valid
                ↓
         Generation + Validation → 1-3 Placed
```

## High-Level Overview

### The Three Questions Minecraft Asks

For every chunk being generated, Minecraft asks three questions:

1. **"Which structures CAN spawn in this dimension/biome?"** (filtering)
2. **"Which structures SHOULD attempt to spawn at this chunk?"** (grid calculation)
3. **"Can this structure ACTUALLY spawn here?"** (terrain validation)

**Question 1** is answered ONCE at world load.
**Question 2** is answered EVERY chunk (this is the bottleneck).
**Question 3** is answered only for structures that passed Question 2.

### Key Insight: Grid-Based Placement

Minecraft doesn't randomly scatter structures. Instead:

- The world is divided into a **grid** for each structure type
- Grid cell size determined by **spacing** parameter (e.g., 32 chunks)
- Each cell has ONE random candidate chunk (determined by **salt** + world seed)
- Structure only attempts placement if chunk matches the candidate

**Example**: Villages with spacing=32
```
Grid Cell (0,0): Candidate chunk = (14, 22) [determined by salt]
Grid Cell (1,0): Candidate chunk = (45, 18)
Grid Cell (0,1): Candidate chunk = (7, 54)
...

Chunk (14, 22) generates → Village attempts placement ✓
Chunk (15, 22) generates → Village skipped (not candidate) ✗
```

This grid system ensures:
- Structures are roughly evenly distributed
- No clustering (except across different structure types)
- Predictable placement (same world seed = same structure positions)

## Phase 1: World Load (One-Time Setup)

### What Happens During World Load

When you create or load a world, Minecraft:

1. **Loads all registries** (structures, biomes, dimensions)
2. **Creates a ChunkGenerator** for each dimension
3. **Builds a StructurePlacementCalculator** with filtered structure sets

**Time Cost**: ~1-2 seconds for heavily modded pack (569 structures)
**Frequency**: Once per dimension (Overworld, Nether, End each get separate calculators)
**Impact**: Negligible (one-time cost)

### Structure Filtering Process

**Starting Point**: 569 structures in global registry

**Filter 1: Dimension Compatibility**
```java
// Pseudo-code
for (Structure structure : allStructures) {
    if (structure.dimension == currentDimension) {
        keep(structure);
    } else {
        discard(structure); // E.g., Nether fortress in Overworld
    }
}
```
**Result**: 569 → ~400 structures (Overworld-compatible)

**Filter 2: Biome Source Compatibility**
```java
// Pseudo-code
for (Structure structure : dimensionStructures) {
    if (structure.validBiomes.overlaps(dimension.biomeSource.biomes)) {
        keep(structure);
    } else {
        discard(structure); // E.g., desert temple in all-ocean world
    }
}
```
**Result**: ~400 → ~80-150 structure sets
- Actual count depends on biome variety in world
- Superflat world: Very few structures pass
- Large biomes world: Most structures pass

**What Reaches the Calculator**: Only 80-150 structure sets, NOT 569!

### Our Mod's Intervention Point

**Where**: `StructurePlacementCalculator.create()` method
**When**: During Filter 2, before calculator is created
**What**: Modify spacing/separation values in `RandomSpreadStructurePlacement`

**Code Location**: `StructurePlacementCalculatorMixin.java`
```java
@Mixin(StructurePlacementCalculator.class)
public class StructurePlacementCalculatorMixin {

    @Inject(method = "create", at = @At("HEAD"))
    private static void modifyStructureSets(
        Stream<RegistryEntry<StructureSet>> structureSets,
        CallbackInfoReturnable<StructurePlacementCalculator> cir
    ) {
        // Transform stream: multiply spacing/separation values
        // spacing 32 → 64 (2.0x multiplier)
        // separation 8 → 16 (2.0x multiplier)
    }
}
```

**Impact**:
- Larger spacing → Larger grid cells → Fewer chunks match grid → Fewer STRUCTURE_START checks
- One-time modification → Benefits ALL chunks for entire world lifetime
- **Performance win**: 2x spacing = ~50% fewer structure attempts

---

## Phase 2: Per-Chunk Structure Start

### The STRUCTURE_START Worldgen Stage

**What It Is**: A mandatory stage in Minecraft's chunk generation pipeline where structures are DECIDED (not placed yet).

**Worldgen Stages** (in order):
```
1. STRUCTURE_START    ← Decide which structures go here
2. STRUCTURE_REFERENCES
3. BIOMES
4. NOISE (terrain generation)
5. SURFACE
6. CARVERS
7. FEATURES           ← Place structures and decorations
8. INITIALIZE_LIGHT
```

**Critical Constraint**: STRUCTURE_START must complete for ALL surrounding chunks before later stages can proceed.

**Why This Matters**: STRUCTURE_START creates a **synchronization bottleneck**. If it takes too long, the entire worldgen pipeline stalls.

### The Grid Algorithm (Step-by-Step)

For each structure set in the calculator, Minecraft runs this algorithm:

#### Example Structure: Villages
- **Spacing**: 32 chunks (vanilla default)
- **Separation**: 8 chunks (minimum distance between villages)
- **Salt**: 10387312 (unique identifier for villages)

#### Example Chunk: (100, 200)

**Step 1: Calculate Grid Cell**
```
cellX = floor(chunkX / spacing) = floor(100 / 32) = floor(3.125) = 3
cellZ = floor(chunkZ / spacing) = floor(200 / 32) = floor(6.25) = 6

Grid cell: (3, 6)
```

**Step 2: Generate Salt-Based Random Offset**
```java
// Pseudo-code (actual Minecraft implementation)
long seed = (worldSeed +
            (long)(cellX * 341873128712L) +
            (long)(cellZ * 132897987541L) +
            structureSalt) & 281474976710655L;

Random random = new Random(seed);

int offsetX = random.nextInt(spacing - separation);
int offsetZ = random.nextInt(spacing - separation);

// Example result for villages in cell (3, 6):
offsetX = 14 (random number from 0 to 24)
offsetZ = 22 (random number from 0 to 24)
```

**Step 3: Calculate Candidate Chunk**
```
candidateX = cellX * spacing + offsetX = 3 * 32 + 14 = 96 + 14 = 110
candidateZ = cellZ * spacing + offsetZ = 6 * 32 + 22 = 192 + 22 = 214

Candidate chunk: (110, 214)
```

**Step 4: Check if Current Chunk Matches Candidate**
```
Current chunk: (100, 200)
Candidate chunk: (110, 214)

Does (100, 200) == (110, 214)? NO

Result: SKIP villages (this chunk is not the village candidate for grid cell (3, 6))
```

**Visual Representation**:
```
Grid Cell (3, 6) boundaries: chunks (96, 192) to (127, 223)

    192                      223 (z-axis)
     ├────────────────────────┤
 96  ┌────────────────────────┐
     │                        │
     │                        │
     │       (100, 200)       │  ← Current chunk (NOT candidate)
     │           ◯            │
     │                        │
     │                        │
     │              (110, 214)│  ← Candidate chunk (✓)
     │                    ●   │
     │                        │
127  └────────────────────────┘
```

### Repeat for All Structure Sets

**For chunk (100, 200)**, Minecraft runs this algorithm for:
- Villages (spacing=32) → SKIP (candidate = 110, 214)
- Pillager Outposts (spacing=32, different salt) → SKIP (candidate = 105, 202)
- Ruined Portals (spacing=25, different salt) → **CHECK** (candidate = 100, 200) ✓
- Ancient Cities (spacing=64) → SKIP (candidate = 64, 128)
- Desert Temples (spacing=32) → SKIP (candidate = 98, 195)
- ... (repeat for all 80-150 structure sets)

**Typical Result**: Out of 80-150 structure sets, only **5-20 structures** match the grid for any given chunk.

### Biome Compatibility Check (Only for Grid Matches)

After grid filtering reduces to 5-20 structures, check biomes:

**Example**: Chunk (100, 200) in **Plains** biome

Grid matches:
- ✓ Ruined Portal → Check biome: Can spawn in plains ✓ → **ATTEMPT PLACEMENT**
- ✓ Desert Well → Check biome: Cannot spawn in plains ✗ → **SKIP**
- ✓ Ice Spike → Check biome: Cannot spawn in plains ✗ → **SKIP**
- ✓ Dungeon → Check biome: Can spawn in plains ✓ → **ATTEMPT PLACEMENT**

**Result**: 5-20 grid matches → 2-10 biome-compatible → Add to placement list

### Structure Generation (Expensive Operation)

For each structure in the placement list (2-10 structures):

**Jigsaw Structures** (villages, bastions, ancient cities):
```
1. Start with root piece (e.g., village center)
2. For each jigsaw block in root:
   ├─ Find compatible jigsaw blocks in template pool
   ├─ Try to place child piece:
   │  ├─ Check rotation/alignment
   │  ├─ Check bounding box intersection with ALL existing pieces (O(n²)!)
   │  ├─ Check terrain suitability
   │  └─ If fits: Add piece, recurse to its jigsaw blocks
   └─ Repeat until max depth or no more pieces fit

3. Create StructureStart with all generated pieces
```

**Complexity**: O(n²) where n = number of pieces in structure
- Small village (10 houses): ~100 intersection checks
- Large ancient city (200+ pieces): ~40,000 intersection checks!

**Template Structures** (temples, igloos):
```
1. Load NBT template from resources
2. Validate terrain (e.g., desert temple needs flat desert)
3. If valid: Create StructureStart with single piece
```

**Complexity**: O(1), much faster than jigsaw

**Time Cost**:
- Simple structures (ruins, ore veins): ~0.1ms
- Medium structures (temples, houses): ~0.5ms
- Complex jigsaw structures (villages): ~2-5ms
- Massive jigsaw structures (ancient cities): ~10-50ms

### Storage in Chunk NBT

Successful structures are stored in chunk data:

```json
{
  "structures": {
    "starts": {
      "minecraft:village_plains": {
        "ChunkX": 100,
        "ChunkZ": 200,
        "BB": [1600, 64, 3200, 1750, 90, 3350],
        "biome": "minecraft:plains",
        "Children": [
          { "template": "village/plains/houses/house_1", ... },
          { "template": "village/plains/houses/house_2", ... }
        ]
      },
      "minecraft:ruined_portal": {
        "ChunkX": 100,
        "ChunkZ": 200,
        "BB": [1605, 64, 3205, 1615, 75, 3215],
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Why This Matters**: Structures are decided in STRUCTURE_START but placed later in FEATURES stage. This two-phase approach allows downstream stages to know structure locations before terrain is finalized.

---

## Phase 3: Structure Placement

### The FEATURES Worldgen Stage

After terrain generation completes, chunks enter the FEATURES stage where:

1. **Structure blocks are placed** (StructureStart.place())
2. **Ores and vegetation are generated**
3. **Lakes and springs are placed**

**For structures**:
- Read StructureStart from chunk NBT (created in Phase 2)
- For each StructurePiece in the structure:
  - Load NBT template (if applicable)
  - Apply StructureProcessors (randomization, loot tables)
  - Place blocks in world
  - Spawn entities (villagers, mobs, chests)

**Time Cost**: ~5-20ms per structure (depends on size)
- Temples: ~5ms
- Villages: ~10-15ms
- Ancient cities: ~20-50ms

**Parallel Execution**: FEATURES stage can process multiple chunks in parallel (unlike STRUCTURE_START which has synchronization constraints).

**Why Placement Is Separate**: Allows structures to span multiple chunks cleanly. Structure decided in origin chunk (100, 200), but pieces can extend into neighboring chunks (101, 200), (100, 201), etc.

---

## Performance Bottlenecks

### Bottleneck 1: STRUCTURE_START Synchronization (PRIMARY)

**Problem**: STRUCTURE_START must complete for ALL surrounding chunks before next stages.

**Impact**:
- Creates synchronization point in otherwise parallel worldgen
- Blocks BIOMES, NOISE, FEATURES stages
- 20-40% of total worldgen time in heavily modded packs

**Scaling**:
- Vanilla (34 structures): ~5-10ms per chunk
- Modded (569 structures): ~20-80ms per chunk
- **4-8x slower**

**Why**: More structures = more grid checks = longer STRUCTURE_START

**Our Mod's Impact**: 2x spacing multiplier → ~50% fewer grid matches → ~10-40ms per chunk → **50% improvement**

### Bottleneck 2: Jigsaw Intersection Checks (SECONDARY)

**Problem**: Each structure piece checks bounding box intersection with every other piece.

**Complexity**: O(n²) where n = number of pieces

**Impact**:
- Ancient city (200 pieces): 40,000 intersection checks
- Per check: ~0.001ms (simple bounding box test)
- Total: ~40ms per ancient city

**Scaling**: Quadratic! 2x more pieces = 4x more checks

**Mitigation**: Structure Layout Optimizer mod addresses this (spatial indexing reduces to O(n log n))

**Our Mod's Impact**: Doesn't directly optimize this, but reducing placement attempts means fewer jigsaw structures generated overall.

### Bottleneck 3: Template Pool Weight Duplication (TERTIARY)

**Problem**: Vanilla template pools duplicate entries for weighted selection.

**Example**:
```java
// Template pool for plains village houses
{
    "village/plains/houses/house_1": weight 100,  // Appears 100 times in pool list
    "village/plains/houses/house_2": weight 50,   // Appears 50 times in pool list
    "village/plains/houses/house_3": weight 30    // Appears 30 times in pool list
}

// Pool list: [house_1, house_1, house_1, ..., house_2, house_2, ...]
// Total entries: 180
```

**Impact**:
- Jigsaw system shuffles pool and tries each entry
- If house_1 doesn't fit, tries house_1 again (same template, same failure)
- Redundant fit checks waste CPU time

**Mitigation**: Structure Layout Optimizer mod caches fit failures

**Our Mod's Impact**: Not addressed

### Bottleneck 4: NBT Template Loading (ONE-TIME)

**Problem**: Each structure type loads NBT template from disk once.

**Impact**:
- 569 structures = 569 NBT files to load at world start
- ~50ms per NBT file (parse + convert to StructureTemplate)
- Total: ~28 seconds at world load

**Frequency**: One-time per world load
**Mitigation**: NBT templates are cached in StructureTemplateManager

**Our Mod's Impact**: No effect (doesn't reduce number of structure types)

### Bottleneck 5: Memory Allocation During Placement (SYMPTOMS)

**Problem**: Rapid structure generation creates memory pressure.

**Evidence from testing**:
- Memory usage: 1.6 GB → 4.8 GB (fluctuating)
- 2,600 structures placed in 8 minutes
- Each structure creates: bounding boxes, piece lists, NBT data

**Impact**:
- Garbage collection pauses (freeze rendering)
- Not the structure count itself (569 structures = 250 KB registry)
- But the placement RATE (2,600 placements / 8 min = high allocation rate)

**Our Mod's Impact**: Reducing placement attempts → Lower allocation rate → Less GC pressure → Smoother rendering

---

## Why 569 Structures = 17x Slowdown

### The Math

**Vanilla Minecraft**: 34 structures
**Heavily Modded**: 569 structures
**Ratio**: 569 / 34 = **16.7x** (≈17x)

### Where 17x Appears

**Structure Count**:
- ✅ 17x more structures in registry
- ✅ 17x more NBT templates to load (one-time cost)

**Per-Chunk Work**:
- ⚠️ NOT 17x more grid checks per chunk
- ⚠️ Biome filtering reduces 569 → 80-150 compatible structures
- ⚠️ Grid filtering reduces 80-150 → 5-20 attempts

**Actual STRUCTURE_START Cost**:
- Vanilla: ~5-10ms per chunk
- Modded: ~20-80ms per chunk
- **Actual ratio: 4-8x** (not 17x!)

### Why Not Full 17x Impact?

**Filtering is effective**:
1. **Dimension filter**: 569 → 400 (70% kept)
2. **Biome filter**: 400 → 80-150 (20-38% kept)
3. **Grid filter**: 80-150 → 5-20 (6-25% kept)

**Final result**: Only 1-4% of structures actually attempt placement per chunk.

### But Still Problematic!

**Even 4-8x slower** is significant:
- Vanilla worldgen: 50ms per chunk
- Modded worldgen: 200-400ms per chunk
- Exploring 10 chunks/second: 2-4 seconds of lag

**User experience**:
- "Can't keep up!" warnings
- Choppy rendering during exploration
- Multiplayer server lag

### The Compounding Effect

**It's not JUST the structure count**, it's the **compounding effects**:

1. **17x more grid checks** (569 vs 34 structures)
   - Even with filtering, still 4-8x more work

2. **87x more actual placements** (measured in testing)
   - Vanilla: ~30 structures per session
   - Modded: 2,600 structures per 8-minute session
   - Why? Spacing multipliers not applied (config bug)

3. **O(n²) jigsaw assembly** per placed structure
   - 2,600 structures × average 50 pieces each
   - ~130,000 pieces × ~50 intersection checks each
   - = 6.5 million intersection checks

4. **GC pressure** from rapid allocation
   - 2,600 structures × ~100 KB allocation each
   - = 260 MB allocated in 8 minutes
   - Triggers frequent garbage collection

5. **Memory fluctuation** (1.6 GB → 4.8 GB)
   - GC can't keep up with allocation rate
   - Pauses cause rendering stutter

**The kicker**: User's config multipliers weren't applied, so ALL 569 structures used vanilla spacing. This turned a "manageable with spacing" problem into a "computer can't render" problem.

### What Our Mod Fixes

**Primary goal**: Reduce placement ATTEMPTS by increasing spacing

**How**:
- Apply 2-5x spacing multipliers to most structures
- Larger grid cells → Fewer chunks match grid → Fewer STRUCTURE_START attempts

**Target**:
- Reduce 2,600 placements/8min → 200-400 placements/8min (6-13x reduction)

**Expected result**:
- STRUCTURE_START: 20-80ms → 10-40ms per chunk (50% improvement)
- Placement rate: 87 placements/sec → 10-30 placements/sec
- Memory: Stabilize around 2-3 GB (no more 1.6→4.8 GB swings)
- User experience: Smooth rendering, no lag spikes

**Method**:
- Fix config defaults bug (multipliers not being applied)
- Verify multiplier integration actually modifies structure spacing
- Re-test with corrected config

## Glossary

**Biome**: A climate region (plains, desert, ocean, etc.)

**Bounding Box**: 3D rectangular area containing a structure piece (minX, minY, minZ to maxX, maxY, maxZ)

**Chunk**: 16×16×384 block area (Minecraft divides the world into chunks for generation)

**ChunkGenerator**: Minecraft class responsible for generating terrain and structures

**Grid Cell**: Rectangular region in the world defined by spacing parameter (e.g., 32×32 chunks)

**Jigsaw Structure**: Modular structure assembled from pieces (villages, bastions, ancient cities)

**NBT**: Named Binary Tag, Minecraft's file format for storing structured data

**O(n²) Complexity**: Algorithm that takes quadratic time (doubling input = 4x time)

**RandomSpreadStructurePlacement**: Minecraft's grid-based placement algorithm

**Registry**: Minecraft's system for registering game objects (structures, blocks, items)

**Salt**: Unique random number for each structure type, ensures different grid patterns

**Separation**: Minimum distance between structure attempts (in chunks)

**Spacing**: Distance between grid cell centers (in chunks)

**StructureSet**: Group of structures sharing placement rules

**StructureStart**: Represents a structure instance being generated

**StructurePiece**: Individual component of a structure (e.g., village house)

**STRUCTURE_START**: Worldgen stage where structures are decided

**Template**: Pre-built structure stored as NBT file

**Worldgen**: World generation, the process of creating terrain and features
