### For Understanding "Why 569 Structures = Slow"

Read in this order:
1. **placement-algorithm.md** - Section "Why 569 Structures = 17x Slowdown"
2. **diagrams/grid-calculation.txt** - Example 4 "Why 569 Structures ≠ 569 Checks Per Chunk"
3. **placement-algorithm.md** - Section "Performance Bottlenecks"

## Key Findings

### The Algorithm (Simplified)

1. **World Load** (one-time):
   - Filter 569 structures → 400 (dimension) → 80-150 (biome source)
   - Our mod modifies spacing/separation values here
   - Build StructurePlacementCalculator (cached for world lifetime)

2. **Per-Chunk STRUCTURE_START** (bottleneck):
   - For each of 80-150 structure sets: Calculate grid cell → Generate salt-based random offset → Check if chunk matches candidate
   - Result: 5-20 structures match grid (not 569!)
   - For grid matches: Check biome compatibility
   - Result: 2-10 structures are biome-compatible
   - For biome-compatible: Generate structure pieces (jigsaw assembly, O(n²)!)
   - Result: 1-3 structures successfully created

3. **Placement** (after terrain):
   - Read StructureStart from chunk NBT
   - Place structure pieces in world
   - Our mod tracks placements here for verification

### Why Performance Degrades

**With 569 structures instead of vanilla's 34**:

1. **17x more structures in registry** (obvious)
2. **~4-8x more grid checks per chunk** (after filtering)
3. **~87x more actual placements** (in testing: 2,600 in 8 min vs vanilla ~30)
4. **O(n²) jigsaw assembly** for each placed structure
5. **Memory allocation pressure** (1.6 GB → 4.8 GB swings in testing)

**The compounding effect creates "computer can't render" scenario.**

### How Our Mod Fixes It

**Primary Goal**: Reduce placement ATTEMPTS by increasing spacing

**Method**:
- Intercept StructurePlacementCalculator.create()
- Multiply spacing values (e.g., 32 → 64 with 2x multiplier)
- Larger grid cells → Fewer chunks match grid → Fewer STRUCTURE_START attempts

**Impact**:
- 2x spacing = ~50% fewer structure attempts per chunk
- STRUCTURE_START time: 20-80ms → 10-40ms per chunk
- Placement rate: 87 placements/sec → 10-30 placements/sec (more manageable)
- Memory: Stabilizes (no more 1.6→4.8 GB swings)

**Expected result**: Performance similar to vanilla despite 569 registered structures ✓

## Performance Bottlenecks (Ranked)

### 1. STRUCTURE_START Synchronization (PRIMARY - 40-50% of worldgen time)

**Problem**: Must complete for ALL surrounding chunks before next stages

**Impact**: Blocks parallel worldgen pipeline

**Cost**: 20-80ms per chunk (heavily modded) vs 5-10ms (vanilla)

**Our Solution**: ✅ Spacing multipliers reduce attempts → 50% improvement

### 2. Jigsaw Intersection Checks (SECONDARY - O(n²) per structure)

**Problem**: Each piece checks collision with every other piece

**Impact**: Ancient city (200 pieces) = 40,000 checks

**Cost**: ~40ms per large jigsaw structure

**Our Solution**: ⚠️ Doesn't directly address, but fewer placements = fewer checks overall

**Alternative**: Structure Layout Optimizer mod (spatial indexing)

### 3. Excessive Placement Attempts (CONFIG BUG)

**Problem**: Spacing multipliers not applied in user's config

**Impact**: ALL 569 structures using vanilla spacing = extreme density

**Cost**: 2,600 placements in 8 min (87x vanilla!)

**Our Solution**: ✅ Fix config bug → Apply multipliers correctly

### 4. Template Pool Weight Duplication (TERTIARY)

**Problem**: Vanilla duplicates entries for weighted selection

**Impact**: 10-30x redundant fit checks for high-weight templates

**Our Solution**: ❌ Not addressed

**Alternative**: Structure Layout Optimizer mod (caches fit failures)

### 5. NBT Template Loading (ONE-TIME)

**Problem**: 569 structures = 569 NBT files to load

**Impact**: ~28 seconds at world load

**Our Solution**: ❌ Can't reduce (569 structure types remain)

**Mitigation**: Acceptable (one-time cost)

## Validation Strategy

Our mod includes a verification system to confirm spacing multipliers work:

1. **PlacementTracker**: Mixin into StructureStart.place() to record placements
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate average spacing, compare to expected
3. **/xeenaa stats**: In-game command to view placement counts and spacing
4. **Export**: JSON export for external analysis

**Acceptance Criteria**: Variance within 20% of expected spacing for 90%+ of structures
