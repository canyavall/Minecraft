**Completion Date**: October 19, 2025
**Analysis Report**: `.claude/epics/04-multiplayer-ownership-and-ui/P4-TASK-003.1-Ranged-Guard-Stats-Analysis.md`

**Goal**: Research and compare ranged guard (Sharpshooter) combat statistics with vanilla Minecraft bow-using mobs (Skeleton, Pillager) to ensure guards are balanced and competitive.

**Analysis Completed**: ‚úÖ ALL RESEARCH AREAS COVERED
- ‚úÖ Attack range analyzed and compared
- ‚úÖ Damage output breakdown by tier
- ‚úÖ Attack speed/fire rate comparison
- ‚úÖ Accuracy comparison
- ‚úÖ Special abilities documented

- ‚úÖ Balance assessment and recommendations provided

**Key Findings**:
1. **Attack Range**: Guards match Skeleton (16 blocks), exceed Pillager (8 blocks)
2. **Damage**: Lower base (2.5 vs 3-4 vanilla), compensated by special abilities at higher tiers
3. **Attack Speed**: Tier 4 guards faster than both vanilla mobs (0.9s vs 1-3s)
4. **Accuracy**: Tier 4 matches Skeleton Normal difficulty (accuracy 6)
5. **Special Abilities**: Guards have significant advantage (Double Shot, Multishot, Precision Shot, Slowness arrows)
6. **Tactical AI**: Far superior positioning, kiting, and high-ground seeking

**Balance Assessment**:
‚úÖ **Intentional progression curve** - weak early, strong late
‚úÖ **Recommended**: Keep current balance (fits RPG investment model)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Optional**: Consider tier-based damage scaling if early guards feel too weak

**Research Areas**:
1. **Attack Range**:
   - When guards start aiming/shooting
   - Comparison with Skeleton and Pillager ranges

2. **Damage Output**:
   - Guard arrow damage by tier

- enable_guard_owner_protection: boolean (default: true)
- guard_owner_protection_range: double (default: 20.0)
- guard_owner_protection_duration: int (default: 600 ticks / 30 seconds)
```

4. **Team/Party Integration** (Future-proof):
   - Don't attack party members
   - Don't attack allies
   - Placeholder for future team system

5. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Guard displays angry particle effect
   - Owner receives notification: "Your guards are protecting you!"

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Guards attack players who damage owner
- [ ] Protection range configurable
- [ ] Duration configurable and works correctly
- [ ] Can be disabled via config
- [ ] Visual/audio feedback working
- [ ] Balanced and not exploitable
