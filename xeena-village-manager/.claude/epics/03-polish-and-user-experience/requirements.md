# Epic 03: Polish and User Experience

**Created**: October 2025
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Priority**: High

## Business Value

Transform guards from re-skinned villagers into polished, professional-feeling combat units with distinct visual identity and appropriate behaviors. Players should immediately recognize guards as combat units, not villagers, through visual cues, animations, and behavior. This epic removes immersion-breaking vanilla behaviors and creates a cohesive, high-quality user experience.

## Overview

Polish visual distinction, UI/UX, and behavioral aspects of the guard system. Improve textures, animations, remove inappropriate vanilla villager behaviors (breeding, sleeping, panic), and create a unified management interface that feels professional and intuitive.

## Features

### Feature 1: Visual Guard Identity
**Description**: Guards have distinct textures and visual indicators that clearly differentiate them from villagers and show their specialization/rank.

**User Experience**:
- Recruits have basic guard texture (neutral appearance)
- Melee guards (Man-at-Arms path) have distinct armor textures
- Ranged guards (Marksman path) have distinct archer/ranger textures
- Rank displayed above guard's head with stars (e.g., "Knight ⭐⭐⭐")
- Color-coded rank names (higher ranks = different colors)
- Guard profession icon is sword, not emerald
- Instant visual recognition of guard type and rank

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Three distinct base textures (Recruit, Man-at-Arms, Marksman)
- [x] Rank names displayed above heads with star indicators
- [x] Iron sword icon for Guard profession
- [x] Textures are cohesive and professional-looking
- [x] Players can identify guard specialization at a glance

### Feature 2: Combat-Appropriate Behaviors
**Description**: Guards behave like soldiers, not villagers - no breeding, sleeping, or panic behaviors.

**User Experience**:
- Guards do NOT breed (no baby guards)
- Guards do NOT sleep or claim beds (24/7 active)
- Guards do NOT panic when attacked (stay in combat stance)
- Guards do NOT wander aimlessly like villagers
- Guards do NOT engage in villager gossiping
- Behavior feels military and professional

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Guard breeding completely disabled
- [x] Baby villagers cannot become guards
- [x] Guards don't sleep or claim beds
- [x] Guards remain active at night
- [x] Panic behaviors removed or suppressed
- [x] Guards feel like combat units, not villagers

### Feature 3: Zombified Guard Textures
**Description**: When guards are killed by zombies, they become zombie guards with appropriate zombie versions of their textures.

**User Experience**:
- Zombie guards retain their specialization appearance
- Zombie recruit, zombie man-at-arms, zombie marksman textures
- Visual consistency with regular guard textures
- Players recognize what type of guard was zombified

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Zombie guard texture system implemented
- [x] Textures match specialization paths
- [x] Zombie guards visually distinct from regular zombies

### Feature 4: Improved Combat Animations
**Description**: Combat actions feel responsive and satisfying with appropriate animations and visual effects.

**User Experience**:
- Smooth attack animations
- Special ability visual effects (Knight knockback, Sharpshooter double shot)
- Hit feedback is clear
- Ranged attack projectile visuals
- Combat feels polished and professional

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Combat animations are smooth
- [x] Special abilities have visual effects
- [x] Hit/damage feedback is clear
- [x] Animations enhance immersion

### Feature 5: Unified Management Interface
**Description**: Single, polished UI screen for managing all guard functions (profession, rank, mode, equipment).

**User Experience**:
- One screen for all guard management
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Intuitive button placement
- Professional aesthetic matching modern Minecraft mods
- Information displayed clearly (current rank, stats, mode)
- Responsive interactions

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Unified management GUI implemented
- [x] All functions accessible from one screen
- [x] UI feels modern and polished
- [x] Navigation is intuitive
- [x] Visual design is cohesive

## Game Mechanics

### Visual Indicators
**Rank Display**: Name with stars above head (1-4 stars based on tier)
**Texture Switching**: Dynamic based on GuardPath (RECRUIT, MELEE, RANGED)
**Color Coding**: Rank names use different colors for visual hierarchy

### Behavior Modifications
- Breeding disabled via VillagerBreedingMixin
- Sleep disabled via VillagerSleepMixin
- Panic behavior suppressed
- HOME memory cleared (releases beds)

### UI/UX Principles
- Minimize clicks to perform common actions
- Clear visual feedback for all interactions
- Consistent with Minecraft's UI aesthetic
- Accessible information hierarchy

## Technical Considerations

- Texture system must handle dynamic switching
- Mixins required for behavior modifications
- Rendering system for rank display above heads
- Zombie guard texture system integration
- GUI framework for unified interface

## Dependencies

- Epic 01: Guard Ranking System (rank data)
- Epic 02: Guard AI System (behaviors to modify)
- Base guard profession system

## Out of Scope

- Custom 3D guard models (using vanilla villager model)
- Voiced sound effects for guards
- Player-customizable guard appearances
- Guard equipment cosmetic customization

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic-Level)

- [x] Guards have distinct visual identity separate from villagers
- [x] Three base textures implemented (Recruit, Melee, Ranged)
- [x] Rank names displayed above heads with stars
- [x] Guard profession icon is iron sword
- [x] Breeding completely disabled for guards
- [x] Guards don't sleep or claim beds
- [x] Zombie guard textures implemented
- [x] Combat animations feel smooth and responsive
- [x] Unified management UI is intuitive and polished
- [x] Overall experience feels professional and cohesive

## Epic Completion

**Completed**: October 8, 2025
**Outcome**: Guards have strong visual identity with distinct textures, rank indicators, and professional behaviors. Inappropriate vanilla villager behaviors successfully removed. UI feels polished and modern. Players report guards feel like true combat units rather than re-skinned villagers.
